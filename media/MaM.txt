in the weeksthat followed group readings were held  people  meeting  each  other wouldquote and compare favourite passages there was talk of little else certainsentences from the novel immediately became proverbial the very language ofthe novel  was a  contradiction of everything wooden official  imposed itwas a joy to speak     when the second part appeared in  the january  1967 issue of moskva itwas greeted with the same enthusiasm yet this was not the excitement causedby the emergence of a new  writer as when  aleksandr solzhenitsyns one dayin the  life of ivan denisovich  appeared in the magazine novy mir in  1962bulgakov  was neither  unknown  nor forgotten  his plays  had begun  to  berevived in theatres during the late fifties and were  published in 1962 hissuperb  life of monsieur de  moliere  came out  in that same year his earlystories were reprinted then  in 1965 came the  theatrical novel based onhis years of experience with stanislavskys renowned moscow art theatre andfinally
in  1966  a volume of selected prose was published  containing  thecomplete text  of  bulgakovs first novelthe  white  guard written in thetwenties  and  dealing with nearly contemporary events of  the russian civilwar in  his  native kiev  and the ukraine a book which in its clearsightedportrayal of human courage and weakness ranks among the truest depictions ofwar in all of literature     bulgakov was known well enough then but outside a very  small groupthe existence of the  master and  margarita was completely unsuspected thatcertainly  accounts  for some of the amazement caused by its publication itwas thought that virtually all of bulgakov had found its way into print andhere  was not some  minor literary remains but  a major novel the  authorscrowning  work  then  there were the qualities of  the  novel itself  itsformal originality  its devastating  satire of  soviet life and  of sovietliterary  life in particular its theatrical rendering of the great terrorof the thirties  the
audacity of its portrayal of jesus  christ and pontiuspilate  not to mention satan but above all the  novel breathed an air offreedom artistic  and spiritual which had  become rare indeed not only insoviet russia we  sense  it in  the special tone  of  bulgakovs writing acombination  of  laughter  satire  caricature  buffoonery  and  the mostunguarded vulnerability two aphorisms detachable from the novel may suggestsomething of the complex  nature of this freedom and  how it may have struckthe novels first readers one is the muchquoted manuscripts  dont burnwhich  seems  to  express  an  absolute  trust  in  the triumph  of  poetryimagination the  free word  over terror  and oppression  and  could  thusbecome a watchword  of the intelligentsia the publication of the master andmargarita was taken as a proof of the assertion in fact during a moment offear early in his work on the novel  bulgakov did burn what he had writtenand yet as we see it refused to stay burned this moment of
fear howeverbrings me to the second aphorism  cowardice is the most terrible of vices which  is repeated with slight variations several times in the novel morepenetrating than the defiant manuscripts dont burn this word touched theinner experience of generations of russians to portray that experience withsuch candour required another sort of freedom and a love  for something morethan culture gratitude for such perfect expression  of this other deeperfreedom must surely have  been part of  the enthusiastic response of readersto the novels first appearance     and then  there was the sheer  unlikeliness of its publication by 1966the thaw that had followed stalins death was over and  a  new freeze  wascoming the hopes awakened by the publication of one day in the life of ivandenisovich the first public acknowledgement of  the existence of the gulaghad been disappointed  in 1964 came the notorious trial of the  poet josephbrodsky and a year later the trial of the writers andrei sinyavsky
and yulidaniel both sentenced to terms  in that same gulag solzhenitsyn saw a  newstalinization approaching made worse by the terrible  sense of  repetitionstagnation and  helplessness such  was the monotonously  grim atmosphere ofthe brezhnev era and in the midst of it there suddenly burst the master andmargarita not only an anomaly but an impossibility a sort of cosmic errorevidence  of  some  hidden  but fatal crack in the  system of soviet  powerpeople kept asking how could they have let it happen     bulgakov began work on the first version of the novel early in 1929 orpossibly  at the  end of 1928  it  was  abandoned taken up  again burnedresurrected  recast and revised many times it accompanied bulgakov throughthe period of greatest  suffering for his  people   the  period  of forcedcollectivization and  the  first  fiveyear  plan which decimated  russiaspeasantry and  destroyed her  agriculture the period of  expansion  of  thesystem of corrective labour camps of the penetration
of the secret policeinto all areas of life  of  the liquidation of the intelligentsia  of vastparty purges and  the  moscow show trials in literature the same strugglewent  on in miniature and with the same results bulgakov was not arrestedbut by 1930 he found himself so far excluded that he could no longer publishor produce  his work in an extraordinarily forthright letter to the centralgovernment he asked for permission to emigrate since the hostility  of theliterary  powers made it  impossible for him  to live if emigration was notpermitted and if i am condemned to keep silent in the soviet union for therest of my  days then i  ask the soviet government  to give me  a job in myspeciality and assign me to a theatre as a titular director stalin himselfanswered this letter by telephone  on  17  april and shortly afterwards themoscow  art theatre  hired  bulgakov  as an assistant  director and literaryconsultant  however  during  the  thirties only his  stage adaptations  ofgogols dead souls
and cervantes don quixote were granted a normal run hisown plays either  were not staged at  all or were quickly withdrawn and hislife  of monsieur de moliere written in 19325 for the collection lives ofillustrious  men  was rejected  by the publisher these  circumstances  areeverywhere present in the master and margarita which was in part bulgakovschallenge to the rule  of terror in literature the successive stages of hiswork  on the novel his  changing evaluations of the nature of the book  andits characters reflect events  in his life and his  deepening grasp of whatwas at stake in the struggle  i will  briefly  sketch what the study of hisarchives has made known of this process     the  novel in its definitive  version is  composed of two distinct  butinterwoven  parts  one  set  in  contemporary moscow the other in  ancientjerusalem called yershalaim its central characters are woland satan andhis retinue the poet ivan homeless pontius pilate an unnamed writer knownas  the master
and  margarita  the  pilate story is condensed into  fourchapters and focused on four  or  five largescale figures the moscow storyincludes a whole array of minor characters  the pilate  story which passesthrough a  succession  of narrators finally joins the moscow  story  at theend when the fates of pilate and the master are simultaneously decided theearliest version narrated by  a firstperson  chronicler and entitled theengineers hoof was written  in the first few months  of 1929 it containedno trace  of  margarita and  only a faint  hint of  the  master in  a  minorcharacter representing the old intelligentsia the pilate story was confinedto a single  chapter this version  included the  essentials  of  the moscowsatire which afterwards underwent  only minor revisions and rearrangementsit began in much the  same way  as  the  definitive version with a dialoguebetween a peoples poet and an  editor here  of an antireligious magazinethe  godless  on the correct portrayal  of  christ  as 
an exploiter of theproletariat  a  stranger woland appears and surprised at their unbeliefastounds  them  with  an  eyewitness account of  christs crucifixion  thisaccount forms the second chapter entitled the gospel of woland     clearly what first spurred bulgakov to write the novel was his outrageat the portrayals of christ in soviet antireligious propaganda the godlesswas an actual monthly magazine of atheism published from 1922 to 1940 hisresponse was based on a  simple reversal  a vivid circumstantial narrativeof what  was thought to  be a  myth invented by  the ruling class  and  abreaking down of the selfevident reality of moscow life by the intrusion ofthe  stranger this device fundamental to the novel would be  more fullyelaborated in  its final  form  literary  satire was  also present from thestart the  fifth chapter of  the  definitive version entitled  there  weredoings at  griboedovs already appeared  intact in  this  earliest  draftwhere it  was entitled mania
furibunda in may of 1929 bulgakov sent thischapter  to a  publisher who  rejected it  this was  his  only  attempt topublish anything from the novel     the second version from later in the same year was a reworking of thefirst four chapters filling out certain episodes and  adding the  death  ofjudas to the second chapter which also  began to detach  itself from wolandand  become  a more autonomous narrative  according to  the authors  wifeelena  sergeevna bulgakov partially destroyed  these  two versions  in  thespring of 1930   threw them in the fire in the writers own words whatsurvived were two large notebooks with many pages  torn out this was at theheight of the  attacks on bulgakov  in the press  the moment of his letterto the government     after  that  came  some  scattered   notes  in   two  notebooks   keptintermittently over the next two years which was a very difficult time  forbulgakov in the upperrighthand corner of the second he wrote     lord  help  me to finish 
my novel 1931 in  a  fragment of a laterchapter  entitled wolands  flight  there  is  a  reference  to  someoneaddressed familiarly as ty who is told that he will meet with schubert andclear mornings this is obviously  the master though he is not  called sothere  is also  the  first mention of the name of  margarita in  bulgakovsmind the  main outlines of a new  conception  of  the  novel were evidentlyalready clear     this  new version  he  began  to  write in  earnest in october of 1932during a visit to leningrad with elena  sergeevna whom he had just marriedthe model for margarita  who had  now entered  the  composition she waspreviously married to a highranking  military  official who for  some timeopposed her wish to leave him for the  writer leading  bulgakov to think hewould never see her again his wife was surprised that he could set to workwithout having any notes or earlier drafts with him but bulgakov explainedi  know it by heart he continued working not without
long interruptionsuntil  1936 various new tides occurred to him all still referring to satanas the central figure  the great chancellor satan  here i am  the blacktheologian he has come the  hoofed consultant as in the earliest versionthe time of the action is 24 5 june the feast of st john traditionally atime of magic enchantments later  it  was moved to  the time of  the springfull  moon the nameless  friend  of  margarita is  called  faust in somenotes though not in the text itself he  is also called the  poet and ismade the author of a novel which corresponds to the  gospel of woland fromthe  first  drafts this  historical section is now broken up and moved to alater place in the novel coming closer to what would  be the arrangement inthe final version     bulgakov laboured especially  over the conclusion of the novel and whatreward  to give the  master  the ending  appears  for  the first time  in achapter entitled last flight  dating  from july  1956  it differs littlefrom 
the  final version in it however  the master is told explicitly anddirectly     the house  on  sadovaya  and the horrible bosoy  will vanish from  yourmemory but  with  them will go hanozri  and  the forgiven  hegemon  thesethings are not  for your spirit you will never raise  yourself  higher youwill not see yeshua you will never leave your refuge     in an earlier note bulgakov had written even more tellingly you willnot hear the  liturgy  but you  will listen to the  romantics     thesewords  which do not appear  in the definitive text tell us  how  painfullybulgakov weighed the question of cowardice and guilt in considering the fateof  his hero and how we should understand the ending of the final  versionthey  also  indicate a  thematic link  between  pilate the master and  theauthor  himself connecting  the  historical  and  contemporary parts of thenovel     in  a brief reworking from 19367 bulgakov  brought the  beginning ofthe  pilate story back to the second chapter where
it would remain and  inanother reworking  from 19378 he finally  found the definitive tide for thenovel in this version the original narrator a characterized chronicleris  removed  the  new narrator is  that fluid voice   moving freely  fromdetached  observation  to  ironic  double  voicing  to  the  most  personalinterjection  which is perhaps the finest achievement of bulgakovs art     the  first typescript of the  master and margarita dating to 1958 wasdictated  to  the typist  by  bulgakov  from this last revision  with  manychanges  along  the  way  in  1939  he  made  further  alterations  in  thetypescript the  most important of which concerns the fate  of the hero  andheroine  in  the  last  manuscript  version the  fate  of  the  master andmargarita announced to  them by  woland is to follow pilate up the path ofmoonlight to find  yeshua  and  peace  in the typescript the fate  of  themaster  announced to woland by matthew levi speaking for yeshua is not tofollow pilate but
to go to his eternal refuge with margarita in a  rathergermanromantic setting with schuberts music and blossoming cherry  treesasked by woland but why dont you take him with you into the  light levireplies in a sorrowful voice he  does  not deserve the  light he deservespeace bulgakov still pondering the problem of the masters guilt and hisown for what  he  considered  various compromises including his  work on aplay about stalins youth went  back to his notes and revisions from 1936but  lightened  their severity with an enigmatic irony this was to  be  thedefinitive resolution clearly the master is  not to be  seen as  a  heroicmartyr  for art or  a christfigure bulgakovs gentle  irony is a warningagainst the  mistake  more  common in  our  time than  we might  think  ofequating artistic mastery with a  sort of saintliness or  in kierkegaardsterms of confusing the aesthetic with the ethical     in the  evolution of the  master  and margarita  the moscow  satire ofwoland
and  his retinue versus the literary powers and the imposed normalityof soviet life in general is there from the first and  comes to involve themaster when  he appears acquiring details  from the  writers own life  andwith them a more personal  tone alongside the  bantering  irreverence of thedemonic retinue the pilate story on the other hand the story of an act ofcowardice  and an interrupted dialogue gains in weight and independence  asbulgakovs  work  progresses from a single inset episode  it  becomes  thecentrepiece of the novel setting off the contemporary events and serving astheir measure  in style and form it is a counterpoint  to the  rest  of thebook finally rather late in the process the master  and margarita appearwith margarita coming to dominate the second part of the novel her story isa romance in the old sense  the celebration of a beautiful woman of a truelove and of personal courage     these three stories in form as  well as content embrace virtually allthat was  excluded
from official soviet ideology  and its literature but ifthe  confines  of  socialist  realism are  utterly  exploded  so are  theconfines of more traditional novelistic realism the master and margarita asa  whole is a consistently  free verbal construction which  true to its ownpremises can recreate ancient jerusalem  in the smallest  physical detailbut can also alter the specifics of the new testament and play variations onits  principal  figures  can combine  the  realities of  moscow  life  withwitchcraft vampirism the tearing off and replacing  of heads can describefor several  pages the sensation of flight on a broomstick  or the gatheringof the infamous  dead at satans annual  spring  ball  can combine the mostacute  sense  of  the  fragility  of  human  life  with  confidence  in  itsindestructibility bulgakov  underscores the continuity of this verbal worldby having certain  phrases   oh gods my gods bring me poison evenby moonlight i have  no peace  migrate from one character
to another  orto  the  narrator  a  more  conspicuous case  is the  pilate  story itselfsuccessive parts of which are told by woland dreamed by the  poet homelesswritten by the master and read  by margarita while the whole preserves itsstylistic unity  narrow notions of  the  imitation  of reality break downhere but the master and margarita is true to the broader sense of the novelas a freely developing form embodied in  the works of dostoevsky  and gogolof swift and  sterne of  cervantes rabelais and apuleius  the mobile  butpersonal  narrative voice of the novel the closest model for which bulgakovmay  have  found  in  gogols dead souls is  the  perfect  medium for  thiscontinuous verbal construction there is no multiplicity of narrators in thenovel the voice is always  the same but  it has unusual range picking upparodying  or  ironically  undercutting  the  tones  of  the  novels  manycharacters with undertones of lyric and epic poetry and old popular tales     bulgakov  always  loved
clowning and agreed with e t a hoffmann thatirony and  buffoonery are expressions  of the deepest contemplation of lifein all its  conditionality it is not  by chance that his stage adaptationsof the  comic masterpieces of gogol and cervantes coincided with the writingof the master and margarita  behind such specific influences  stands  theageold  tradition  of  folk humour with  its  carnivalized worldview  itsreversals  and  dethronings its  relativizing of  worldly  absolutes    atradition  that  was  the  subject  of  a  monumental  study  by  bulgakovscountryman  and  contemporary mikhail  bakhtin bakhtins  rabelais  and hisworld  which in its way  was as  much an explosion  of  soviet  reality  asbulgakovs novel appeared in 1965 a year before the  master and margaritathe  coincidence  was  not  lost  on  russian  readers  commenting  on  itbulgakovs  wife noted  that  while there  had never  been any direct  linkbetween the  two  men  they were  both responding to  the  same  historicalsituation
from the same cultural basis     many observations  from bakhtins  study seem to  be aimed  directly atbulgakovs intentions  none more so than his comment on rabelaiss travestyof the  hidden  meaning  the  secret  the  terrifying  mysteries  ofreligion politics and  economics  laughter must liberate the gay truth ofthe world  from the  veils of  gloomy lies  spun by the seriousness of fearsuffering  and  violence  the settling  of  scores  is also  part  of thetradition  of  carnival  laughter perhaps the  most  pure  example  is  thetestament of the poet francois villon who in the liveliest verse handed outappropriate legacies to all his enemies thus entering into tradition  andeven earning himself a place in the fourth book of  rabelaiss gargantua andpantagruel so too bakhtin says of rabelais     in his novel   he uses the popularfestive system of images with itscharter of freedoms consecrated by many centuries and he uses it to inflicta severe punishment upon  his foe the
gothic  age    in this setting  ofconsecrated rights rabelais  attacks  the fundamental dogmas and sacramentsthe holy of holies of medieval ideology     and he comments further on the broad nature of this tradition     for thousands of years the people have  used these festive comic imagesto express their criticism their deep distrust of official truth and theirhighest hopes and aspirations freedom was  not so much an exterior right asit  was  the  inner  content  of  these images it was the thousandyearoldlanguage  of  feariessness  a language with no reservations  and omissionsabout the world and about power     bulgakov drew on  this same source  in  settling  his  scores  with thecustodians of official literature and official reality     the  novels   form  excludes  psychological  analysis  and  historicalcommentary hence the quickness  and pungency  of bulgakovs writing at thesame time it allows bulgakov to  exploit all the theatricality of its greatscenes  storms flight the attack 
of vampires all  the  antics  of  thedemons koroviev and behemoth the seance in the variety theatre the ball atsatans  but also the  meeting  of  pilate and  yeshua the crucifixion  aswitnessed  by matthew  levi the murder  of judas in  the moonlit garden  ofgethsemane     bulgakovs treatment of gospel figures is the most controversial aspectof  the master  and margarita and has met with the greatest incomprehensionyet his premises are made clear in the very first pages of the novel in thedialogue between  woland and the atheist  berlioz by the deepest  irony  ofall the prince of this world stands as guarantor of the other world itexists since he exists but he says nothing  directly about it apart  fromdivine revelation the only language  able to speak of the other world  isthe language of parable of  this  language kafka wrote in his  parable onparables     many complain that the words of the wise are always merely parables andof no use in daily life which is the only life we have
when the sage saysgo over he does not mean that we should cross to some actual place whichwe  could  do  anyhow  if  it was worth the trouble he means  some fabulousyonder something unknown to us  something too  that he cannot  designatemore  precisely and  therefore cannot  help us here in the least all theseparables  really  set  out  to  say  simply  that  the  incomprehensible  isincomprehensible  and  we  know  that already  but  the  cares we have  tostruggle with every day that is a different matter     concerning this a  man  once said  why such reluctance  if  you  onlyfollowed the parables you yourselves would become parables and with that ndof all your daily cares     another said i bet that is also a parable     the first said you win     the second said but unfortunately only in parable     the first said no in reality in parable you lose     a similar  dialogue lies at the heart of  bulgakovs novel in it thereare those who belong to parable and those who belong  to
reality  there arethose  who  go over and those who do not there are those who win in parableand become parables themselves and there are those who  win in reality butthis reality belongs to woland its  nature is made chillingly  clear in thebrief  scene when  he and margarita  contemplate  his special  globe wolandsays     for instance do you see this chunk of land washed on one side by theocean  look its filling with  fire a war has started there if you  lookcloser youll see the details     margarita leaned towards  the  globe and saw the  little square of landspread out get  painted in many colours and turn as  it were into a reliefmap and then she  saw the little ribbon of  a river and some village  nearit a little house the size of a pea grew and became the size of a matchboxsuddenly and  noiselessly the roof of this house flew  up along with a cloudof black smoke and  the  walls collapsed so that nothing was  left of  thelittle twostorey box except a small heap  with black smoke
pouring from itbringing her eye stffl  closer  margarita  made  out a small  female figurelying on the ground and next to her in a pool  of blood  a  little  childwith outstretched arms     thats  it  woland  said smiling he had no time to sin  abaddonswork is impeccable     when margarita asks which side this abaddon is on woland replies     he  is of  a rare impartiality and sympathizes equally with both sidesof the  fight owing  to  that the results are always  the  same  for  bothsides     there are others who dispute wolands claim to the power of this worldthey are  absent  or all but  absent from  the master and margarita but thereality of the world seems to be at their disposal to be shaped by them andto bear their imprint their names are caesar  and stalin though absent  inperson they  are omnipresent  their imposed will has become the measure ofnormality and selfevidence in other  words the normality of this world isimposed terror and  as the story of  pilate  shows
this is by  no means atwentiethcentury  phenomenon once terror  is identified with the world itbecomes invisible  bulgakovs portrayal of moscow under stalins  terror isremarkable precisely for its weightless  circuslike theatricality and lackof pathos it is a substanceless reality an empty suit writing  at a deskthe  citizens  have adjusted to  it and learned to play along as they alwaysdo  the  mechanism  of  this forced adjustment  is revealed in the  chapterrecounting nikanor  ivanovichs dream in  which prison  denunciation andbetrayal  become yet  another theatre with  a  kindly and helpful master  ofceremonies berlioz  the comparatist is the  spokesman  for  this normalstate of  affairs  which  is what  makes his  conversation  with woland  sointeresting in  it he  is confronted  with another reality which  he cannotrecognize  he  becomes  unexpectedly  mortal  in the  story  of  pilatehowever  a  moment  of  recognition  does come it occurs  during  pilatesconversation  with
yeshua when  he sees  the wandering  philosophers  headfloat off and in its  place the toothless head of the aged  tiberius caesarthis is the pivotal moment of the novel pilate breaks off his dialogue withyeshua he does not go over and afterwards must sit like  a stone for twothousand years waiting to continue their conversation     parable cuts through the normality of this world only at moments     these  moments  are  preceded by  a  sense  of  dread  or  else  by  apresentiment  of  something  good the first variation is berliozs  meetingwith woland the second is pilates meeting  with yeshua  the  third is theselfbaptism of the poet  ivan homeless before he  goes in  pursuit of themysterious  stranger the fourth is the meeting of the master and margaritathese chance encounters have eternal consequences depending on the responseof  the  person  who must act without  foreknowledge and then  becomes  theconsequences of that action     the touchstone character of the novel is ivan homeless

citizen seven feet tall but  narrow  in the  shoulders unbelievablythin and kindly note with a jeering physiognomy     the life of berlioz had taken such a course that he was unaccustomed toextraordinary  phenomena turning  paler  still  he  goggled  his eyes  andthought in consternation this cant be        but alas it was and the long seethrough citizen was swaying beforehim to the left and to the right without touching the ground     here terror took such possession of berlioz that he shut his eyes whenhe  opened them  again  he  saw  that it  was  all over the  phantasm  haddissolved the checkered  one had  vanished and with that  the blunt needlehad popped out of his heart     pah the  devil exclaimed the editor you know ivan  i nearly hadheatstroke just  now there was even something like a hallucination   heattempted  to smile but  alarm  still jumped  in  his eyes  and  his  handstrembled  however  he  gradually  calmed  down fanned  himself  with  hishandkerchief
and having  said rather cheerfully well and so    wenton with the conversation interrupted by their sodadrinking     this conversation as was learned afterwards was  about jesus  christthe  thing  was  that  the  editor  had  commissioned from the poet  a  longantireligious poem for the next issue  of his journal ivan nikolaevich hadwritten this poem  and in a  very short time but  unfortunately the editorwas not at all satisfied with it homeless had portrayed the  main characterof  his poem  that is jesus  in  very dark  colours but nevertheless thewhole poem  in the editors opinion had to be written  over again  and sothe editor was now giving the poet something of a lecture on jesus with theaim of underscoring the poets essential error     it is hard to  say what precisely had let ivan  nikolaevich down   thedescriptive powers of his talent or a total  unfamiliarity with the questionhe was writing about   but  his jesus came out well completely alive theonceexisting  jesus
though true a  jesus  furnished  with  all  negativefeatures     now  berlioz wanted to prove to  the poet that  the main thing was nothow  jesus was good or  bad but that this same jesus  as a person simplynever existed in the world and all the stories about him were mere fictionthe most ordinary mythology     it  must  be  noted  that the  editor was a wellread  man  and  in hisconversation  very skilfully pointed to ancient  historians  for  instancethe famous philo of alexandria  and  the brilliantly  educatedflavius josephus   who never  said a word about the existenceof jesus displaying a solid erudition mikhail alexandrovich  also informedthe poet among other  things that  the  passage in  the  fifteenth book oftacituss famous annals the  fortyfourth chapter where mention is made ofthe execution of jesus was nothing but a later spurious interpolation     the poet  for  whom  everything the editor  was telling  him was  newlistened attentively to mikhail alexandrovich fixing
his pert green eyes onhim and merely hiccuped from time  to  time cursing the apricot soda underhis breath     theres not a single eastern  religion berlioz was saying in whichas a rule an immaculate virgin did not give birth to a god and in just thesame  wav  without inventing  anything new  the  christians  created theirjesus who in fact  never lived its on this that the main emphasis  shouldbe placed        berliozs high  tenor rang out in  the  deserted  walk  and as mikhailalexandrovich went deeper into  the maze which only a highly  educated  mancan go into without risking a broken  neck the poet learned  more and  moreinteresting and  useful things about  the egyptian  osiris  abenevolent god and the son of heaven and earth and about the phoenician godtammoz and  about marduk  and  even about a  lesser knownterrible  god vitzliputzli once greatly  venerated  by  theaztecs  in mexico and  just at  the  moment  when mikhail alexandrovich wastelling the poet
how the aztecs  used to  fashion figurines of vitzliputzliout of dough  the first man appeared in the walk     afterwards  when frankly  speaking it  was already too late variousinstitutions  presented  reports  describing this man a  comparison of themcannot  but cause  amazement thus the first of them said that the  man wasshort had gold teeth and limped on his right leg the second that the manwas enormously tall had platinum crowns and  limped on his  left leg  thethird  laconically averred that the man had no distinguishing marks it mustbe acknowledged that none of these reports is of any value     first of  all the  man described  did  not  limp on  any leg  and wasneither  short  nor  enormous but  simply  tall as for his  teeth he  hadplatinum crowns on the left side and gold  on the  right  he was wearing anexpensive  grey suit and imported shoes of a matching colour his grey beretwas cocked rakishly over  one ear under his arm 1e  carried a stick with ablack knob shaped  like 
a poodles head  he looked to  be alittle over forty mouth somehow  twisted cleanshaven darkhaired  righteye black left  for some  reason   green dark eyebrows but one higherthan the other in short a foreigner     having passed  by  the  bench  on which  the  editor  and the poet wereplaced  the foreigner gave them a sidelong look stopped  and suddenly satdown on the next bench two steps away from the friends     a  german      thought berlioz an  englishman        thoughthomeless my he must be hot in those gloves     and the foreigner gazed around at the tall buildings that rectangularlyframed the  pond  making it obvious that he was seeing  the  place  for thefirst time and that  it  interested him he  rested  his glance on the upperfloors where the glass dazzlinglv reflected the brokenup sun which was forever departing from  mikhail  alexandrovich then  shifted it lower down  towhere  the  windows   were  beginning  to   darken  before  evening  smiledcondescendingly
at something narrowed his eves put his  hands on  the knoband his chin on his hands     for instance ivan  berlioz was saying you  portrayed the birth ofjesus the son of god very well and satirically but the gist of it is thata whole series  of  sons  of  god were  born before  jesus  like  say thephoenician  adonis  the  phrygian  atris thepersian mithras and to put it briefly not one of them  wasborn or  ever existed jesus included and whats necessary is that insteadof  portraying his birth or suppose the coming of the magiyou portray the absurd  rumours  of their coming otherwise  it follows fromyour story that he really was born        here homeless made an attempt to  stop his painful hiccuping by holdinghis breath which caused him  to  hiccup more painfully  and loudly  and atthat same moment  berlioz interrupted  his  speech  because  the  foreignersuddenly got  up  and  walked towards the writers they  looked  at  him  insurprise     excuse me please
the approaching man began speaking with a foreignaccent but without distorting the words if not being your acquaintance iallow  myself  but  the  subject  of  your  learned  conversation  is  sointeresting that       here he politely  took off his beret and the friends  had nothing leftbut to stand up and make their bows     no rather a frenchman   thought berlioz     a pole    thought homeless     it  must be added that  from  his  first  words  the  foreigner made  arepellent impression on the  poet but berlioz rather liked  him   that isnot liked but  how to put it  was interested or whatever     may i sit down the foreigner asked politely and the friends somehowinvoluntarily  moved apart the foreigner adroidy sat down between them  andat once entered into the conversation     unless i  heard  wrong  you  were  pleased to say  that  jesus  neverexisted the foreigner asked turning his green left eye to berlioz     no  you did  not hear wrong berlioz  replied 
courteously that isprecisely what i was saying     ah how interesting exclaimed the foreigner     what the devil does he want thought homeless frowning     and you were agreeing with  your interlocutor inquired the strangerturning to homeless on his right     a hundred per cent confirmed the man who was fond  of whimsical andfigurative expressions     amazing exclaimed the uninvited interlocutor and casting a thievishglance around and muffling his low voice for some reason he said     forgive my  importunity  but as i  understand along with everythingelse you also do not believe in  god tie made frightened  eyes and addedi swear i wont tell anyone     no we dont believe in god berlioz replied smiling slightly at theforeign tourists fright but we can speak of it quite freely     the  foreigner  sat  back on the  bench and  asked even  with a slightshriek of curiosity     you are  atheists     yes  were atheists berlioz smilingly replied and homeless
thoughtgetting angry latched on to us the foreign goose     oh  how  lovely  the  astonishing  foreigner  cried out  and  beganswivelling his head looking from one writer to the other     in our country atheism does not surprise  anyone berlioz  said  withdiplomatic politeness  the majority of our population consciously and longago ceased believing in the fairytales about god     here the foreigner pulled the following stunt he got up and  shook theamazed editors hand accompanying it with these words     allow me to thank you with all my  heart what are you  thanking himfor homeless  inquired  blinking  for some very important  informationwhich is  of great interest  to me as  a traveller  the outlandish  fellowexplained raising his finger significantly     the  important  information  apparendy  had  indeed  produced  a strongimpression  on  the traveller because he passed his  frightened glance overthe buildings as if afraid of seeing an atheist in every window     no
hes not an englishman  thought berlioz and homeless thoughtwhered he pick up  his russian thats the interesting thing and frownedagain     but allow  me to  ask  you  the  foreign visitor spoke  after  someanxious reflection what then about the  proofs  of  gods existence  ofwhich as is known there are exactly five     alas  berlioz said  with regret not one of these  proofs  is worthanything and  mankind shelved them  long  ago you  must agree that  in therealm of reason there can be no proof of gods existence     bravo cried  the  foreigner  bravo  you have  perfectly  repeatedrestless  old immanuels thought  in this regard but  heresthe hitch he roundly demolished all five proofs  and then as  if  mockinghimself constructed a sixth of his own     kants proof the learned  editor  objected with  a subtle smile isequally  unconvincing not for nothing  did  schiller say that  the  kantianreasoning  on this  question can  satisfy  only  slaves and 
strauss simplylaughed at this proof berlioz spoke thinking all the while but anyhowwho is he and why does he speak russian so well     they  ought to  take  this  kant and  give him a threeyear stretch  insolovki for  such  proofs  ivan nikolaevich  plumped  quiteunexpectedly     ivan berlioz whispered embarrassed     but the suggestion of sending kant  to solovki  not only  did not shockthe foreigner but even sent him into raptures     precisely  precisely he cried and his  green left  eye turned  toberlioz flashed just the  place  for him didnt i tell  him that time atbreakfast     as  you  will  professor but what  youve thought  up  doesnt  hangtogether its clever maybe but mighty unclear youll be laughed at     berlioz goggled his eyes at breakfast  to kant    what is thisdrivel he thought     but the  oudander went on  unembarrassed by berliozs amazement andaddressing  the poet sending him to solovki  is unfeasible for the simplereason 
that  he has been abiding for  over  a  hundred years now in  placesconsiderably more remote  than solovki and to extract him from  there is inno way possible i assure you     too bad the feisty poet responded     yes too bad the stranger agreed his eye flashing and went on     but here is a question that is troubling me if there is no god thenone may  ask  who governs human life and in  general the  whole  order ofthings on earth     man governs  it himself homeless angrily  hastened to reply  to thisadmittedly nonetooclear question     pardon  me the  stranger responded gently but in  order to governone  needs  after  all  to have a  precise plan  for  a  certain at leastsomewhat  decent  length of time  allow me to ask you then how  can  mangovern if  he is not only deprived of the opportunity of making a  plan forat least some ridiculously short period  well say a thousand years   butcannot even vouch for his own tomorrow     and  in fact here the stranger
turned to berlioz imagine that youfor  instance  start  governing  giving  orders  to  others  and yourselfgenerally so to  speak acquire a taste for it and suddenly you get hem hem  lung  cancer    here the  foreigner smiled sweetly and ifthe thought of lung cancer  gave him pleasure  yes cancer   narrowinghis eyes like a cat he repeated the sonorous word  and so your governingis over     you are no  longer  interested  in  anyones fate  but  your own yourfamily starts lying  to  you feeling that something is wrong you  rush  tolearned doctors then to quacks  and sometimes  to fortunetellers as welllike  the first so the second  and third are completely  senseless as  youunderstand  and it all ends tragically a man who still recently thought hewas governing something suddenly winds up lying motionless in a wooden boxand the people around him seeing that the man lying there is no longer goodfor anything burn him in an oven     and sometimes its worse still
the man  has  just  decided  to  go tokislovodsk  here the foreigner  squinted at berlioz   a trifling matterit seems but even this he cannot accomplish because suddenly no one knowswhy he slips and falls under a tramcar are you going to say it was he whogoverned himself that way would it not be more correct to think that he wasgoverned by  someone else entirely and  here  the unknown man burst into astrange little laugh     berlioz listened with great attention to the unpleasant story about thecancer and the tramcar and certain alarming thoughts began to torment himhes not a foreigner   hes not a foreigner    he  thought  hes amost peculiar specimen  but excuse me who is he then     youd  like  to   smoke  i  see   the  stranger  addressed  homelessunexpectedly which kind do you prefer     what have you got several the poet who  had run out of cigarettesasked glumly     which do you prefer the stranger repeated     okay  our brand homeless replied
spitefully     the unknown man immediately  took  a cigarette case from his pocket andoffered it to homeless     our brand        editor and  poet were  both struck not so much by our  brand preciselyturning up in the cigarette case as by the cigarette case itself it was ofhuge  size  made  of pure gold and  as it was opened a  diamond triangleflashed white and blue fire on its lid     here the writers  thought differently berlioz no a foreigner andhomeless well devil take him eh     the poet and the owner of the cigarette case lit up but the nonsmokerberlioz declined     i must counter him like  this berlioz decided yes man  is mortalno one disputes that but the thing is       however before he managed to utter these words the foreigner spoke     yes man is mortal but that would be only half the trouble the worstof  it is  that hes sometimes unexpectedly mortal  theres the trick andgenerally hes unable to say what hes going to do this same evening    
what  an absurd way of putting  the question  berlioz  thought andobjected     well  theres some  exaggeration here about  this same evening i  doknow more or less certainly it goes without  saying if a brick should fallon my head on bronnaya        no brick the  stranger interrupted imposingly  will ever  fall  onanyones head just out of  the blue in this particular case i assure  youyou are not in danger of that at all you will die a different death     maybe you know what kind precisely berlioz  inquired with  perfectlynatural irony getting drawn into an utterly  absurd conversation and willtell me     willingly the unknown man responded he  looked berlioz up and  downas if he were going to make him a suit muttered through his teeth somethinglike one two    mercury in the second house    moon gone   six disaster      evening  seven     then announced loudly and joyfullyyour head will be cut off     homeless  goggled his  eyes wildly  and  spitefully
at  the  insouciantstranger and berlioz asked grinning crookedly     by whom precisely enemies interventionists     no replied his interlocutor by a russian woman a komsomolgirl     hm     berlioz mumbled vexed at the strangers utde joke  wellexcuse me but thats not very likely     and i beg you  to excuse me the foreigner replied but its so ahyes i  wanted to ask you what are you  going to do tonight  if its not asecret     its  not a  secret right now ill  stop by my place on sadovaya andthen  at ten this evening there  will be  a meeting at massolit and  i willchair it     no that simply cannot be the foreigner objected firmly     why not     because  the foreigner replied  and narrowing his eyes looked intothe  sky where  anticipating  the  cool of  the evening black  birds weretracing noiselessly annushka has already bought the sunflower oil and hasnot only bought it but has already spilled it so the meeting will not takeplace    
here quite understandably silence fell under the lindens     forgive  me  berlioz  spoke   after  a   pause   glancing   at  thedrivelspouting foreigner but what has sunflower oil got to do with it and which annushka     sunflower oil has  got  this to do with it  homeless suddenly spokeobviously  deciding to declare war on the uninvited  interlocutor have youever happened citizen to be in a hospital for the mentally ill     ivan  mikhail alexandrovich exclaimed quietly but  the foreignerwas not a bit offended and burst into the merriest laughter     i have  i have  and more than once he  cried  out  laughing  butwithout  taking his unlaughing eye off the poet where havent i been onlyits too bad i didnt get around to asking the professor  what schizophreniais so you will have to find that out from him yourself ivan nikolaevich     how do you know my name     gracious ivan nikolaevich who doesnt  know you here the foreignertook out of his pocket the previous
days issue of the literary gazette andivan nikolaevich saw his own picture on the very first page and under it hisvery own  verses but the proof  of fame and popularity which yesterday haddelighted the poet this time did not delight him a bit     excuse me he said and his face darkened could you wait one littlemoment i want to sav a couple of words to my friend     oh with pleasure exclaimed the stranger its so nice  here  underthe lindens and by the way im not in any hurry     listen here  misha the poet whispered drawing berlioz aside hesno foreign  tourist hes  a spy  a russian  emigre who  hascrossed back over ask for his papers before he gets away     you think  so  berlioz whispered worriedly and thought why  hesright     believe me the poet  rasped  into his ear  hes pretending to be afool in  order to  find  out  something or other just  hear how  he  speaksrussian  as  he spoke the poet  kept glancing sideways to  make sure thestranger
did not escape lets go and detain him or hell get away        and the poet pulled berlioz back to the bench by the arm     the unknown man  was not sitting but was  standing near it holding inhis hands some booklet in a darkgrey  binding a  sturdy  envelope  made ofgood paper and a visiting card     excuse  me  for  having forgotten  in  the  heat of our  dispute  tointroduce myself here is my card my passport and an invitation to come tomoscow for a consultation the stranger said weightily giving both writersa penetrating glance     they  were embarrassed the devil he  heard everything    berliozthought and with  a polite gesture indicated that there was no need to showpapers while the foreigner was pushing them at the editor the poet managedto  make out the word  professor  printed in foreign type on the card andthe initial letter of the last name  a double v  w     my  pleasure the editor meanwhile muttered in embarrassment and theforeigner put the papers back
in his pocket     relations were  thus  restored and  all three sat  down  on  the benchagain     youve been invited here as a consultant professor asked berlioz     yes as a consultant     youre german homeless inquired     i   the professor repeated and suddenly fell  to  thinking yesperhaps i am german   he said     you speak real good russian homeless observed     oh  im generally a polyglot and know a  great number of  languagesthe professor replied     and what is your field berlioz inquired     i am a specialist in black magic     there he goes struck in mikhail alexandrovichs head     and    and youve  been invited  here in that capacity he  askedstammering     yes in that capacity the professor confirmed  and explained in astate  library   here   some   original  manuscripts  of  the  tenthcenturynecromancer gerbert of aurillac have  been  found so  it  isnecessary for me to sort them out i am the only specialist in the
world     aha youre a historian berlioz asked with great relief and respect     i am a historian the scholar confirmed and added with  no rhyme  orreason this evening there will be an interesting story at the ponds     once again editor and poet were  extremely surprised but the professorbeckoned them both to him and when they leaned towards him whispered     bear in mind that jesus did exist     you  see professor berlioz  responded  with  a  forced  smile  werespect  your great  learning but  on this question we hold  to a differentpoint of view     theres  no  need  for  any  points  of view  the  strange professorreplied he simply existed thats all     but theres need for some proof   berlioz began theres  no needfor any  proofs replied the professor and he began to speak softly whilehis accent for  some reason disappeared its all  very simple in a  whitecloak with bloodred lining with  the shuffling gait of a cavalryman earlyin the  morning
of  the fourteenth  day  of  the  spring month of nisan   

chapter 2 pontius pilate       in a white cloak  with  bloodred lining with the shuffling gait of  acavalryman early in the morning of  the fourteenth day of  the spring monthof  nisan there came out to the  covered colonnade between the two wings ofthe  palace  of  herod  the great  the  procurator of  judeapontius pilate     more than  anything in the world the procurator hated the smell of roseoil and  now  everything foreboded a bad  day because this smell had  beenpursuing the procurator since dawn     it seemed to the procurator that a rosy smell exuded from the cypressesand palms in the garden that the smell of leather trappings and sweat  fromthe convoy was mingled with the cursed rosy flux     from the outbuildings at the back of the palace where the first cohortof  the  twelfth  lightning   legion  which   had   come   toyershalaimwith the  procurator was  quartered a  whiff  ofsmoke reached the colonnade across the upper terrace of the palace and thisslightly acrid  smoke which testified
that the centuries  mess  cooks  hadbegun to prepare dinner was mingled with the same thick rosy scent     oh gods gods why do you punish me    yes no doubt this is itthis  is it again the  invincible terrible illness    hemicrania  whenhalf of the  head aches     theres no remedy for it  no escape  illtry not to move my head        on the mosaic floor by the fountain a chair was  already  prepared andthe  procurator without looking at anyone sat in  it and reached his  handout to one side his secretary  deferentially placed a sheet of parchment inthis  hand  unable to  suppress  a painful  grimace  the procurator  ran acursory sidelong  glance over the writing  returned the  parchment  to thesecretary and said with difficulty     the  accused is from  galilee was  the case sent to thetetrarch     yes procurator replied the secretary     and what then     he   refused  to   make  a   decision  on  the   case   and  sent  thesanhedrinsdeath  sentence
to  you  for  confirmation  thesecretary explained     the procurator twitched his cheek and said quietly     bring in the accused     and at once two legionaries brought  a  man of about twentyseven  fromthe garden terrace to the balcony under the columns and stood him before theprocurators  chair  the man  was  dressed  in  an  old and torn lightbluechiton his head was covered by a white cloth with a leather band around theforehead and his hands were bound behind his back under the mans left eyethere was a large bruise in the corner of his mouth a cut caked with bloodthe man gazed at the procurator with anxious curiosity     the latter paused then asked quiedy in aramaic     so  it was  you  who  incited  the people  to  destroy  the temple  ofyershalaim     the procurator  sat  as if made of stone  while he spoke  and only hislips moved slighdy as he pronounced the words the procurator was as if madeof stone because he was afraid to move his head aflame with infernal pain    
the man with bound hands leaned forward somewhat and began to speak     good man believe me       but me procurator motionless as  before and not  raising  his voice inthe least straight away interrupted him     is it  me that  you are  calling a good man you are mistaken  it  iswhispered about me in yershalaim that  i am a fierce monster  and  that  isperfecdv correct and he  added in the same monotone bring the  centurionratslayer     it  seemed  to everyone that  it became  darker on the balcony when thecenturion of the first century mark nicknamed ratslayer presented himselfbefore the  procurator ratslayer was a head taller than the tallest soldierof  the  legion and so broad in the shoulders that he completely blocked outthe stilllow sun     the procurator addressed the centurion in latin     the  criminal calls me good  man  take  him  outside  for a momentexplain to him how i ought to be spoken to but no maiming     and  everyone except the motionless procurator
followed  mark ratslayerwith their  eyes as  he motioned  to the  arrested man  indicating  that heshould go  with him everyone  generally  followed ratslayer with their eyeswherever he  appeared because of his height and  those who were seeing himfor the first  time  also  because the centurions face was  disfigured hisnose had once been smashed by a blow from a germanic club     marks heavy boots thudded across the mosaic the bound man noiselesslywent  out with  him complete  silence fell  in the colonnade and one couldhear pigeons cooing on the garden terrace near the balcony and water singingan intricate pleasant song in the fountain     the procurator would have liked to get  up put  his  temple  under thespout and stay standing that way but he knew that even that would not helphim     having  brought the arrested  man  from under the columns  out  to  thegarden ratslayer took a whip from the hands of a legionary who was standingat the foot of a bronze statue and swinging easily struck
the arrested manacross the shoulders the centurions movement was casual and light yet thebound man instantly collapsed on the ground as if his legs had been cut fromunder him he gasped for ait the colour drained from his face and his eyeswent vacant     with his left hand only mark heaved the fallen man  into the air  likean empty sack set him on his feet  and spoke nasally in poorly pronouncedaramaic     the roman  procurator  is  called hegemon use  no otherwords stand at attention do you understand me or do i hit you     the arrested man swayed but  got hold of himself his colour returnedhe caught his breath and answered hoarsely     t understand dont beat me     a moment later he was again standing before the procurator     a lustreless sick voice sounded     name     mine the arrested  man hastily responded his whole being expressinga readiness to answer sensibly without provoking further wrath     the procurator said softly     i know my own dont pretend to be
stupider than you are yours     yeshua the prisoner replied prompdy     any surname     hanozri     where do you come from     the town  of gamala replied  the  prisoner indicatingwith his head that  there somewhere far off to his right in the north wasthe town of gamala     who are you by blood     i dont know exactly the arrested man  replied animatedly  i dontremember my parents i was told that my father was a syrian        where is your permanent residence     i have no permanent home the prisoner answered shyly i travel fromtown to town     that  can be  put more briefly  in a word  a vagrant the procuratorsaid and asked     any family     none im alone in the world     can you read and write     yes     do you know any language besides aramaic     yes greek     a swollen eyelid rose an eye clouded with suffering fixed the arrestedman the other eye remained shut     pilate spoke in greek     so it was you who
was going to destroy  the temple building and calledon the people to do that     here the prisoner again became animated his eyes ceased  to show fearand he spoke in greek     never goo    here terror flashed in the prisoners eyes  becausehe had nearly made a slip never hegemon  never in my life was i going todestroy the temple building nor did i incite anyone to this senseless act     surprise showed on the face of the  secretary hunched over a low tableand writing down the testimony he raised his head but immediately bent  itto the parchment again     all sorts of people gather  in this  town for  the  feast among  themthere are  magicians  astrologers  diviners and murderers the procuratorspoke in  monotone and  occasionally also liars you for instance are  aliar it is written  clearly incited to destroy the  temple  people havetestified to it     these good people the prisoner spoke and hastily  adding  hegemonwent on  havent any learning and have
confused everything i told themgenerally im beginning  to be afraid that this confusion may go  on for  avery long time and all because he writes down the things i say incorrecdy     silence fell by now both sick eyes rested heavily on the prisoner     i repeat  to you but for the last time stop pretending that youre amadman  robber pilate  said softly and  monotonously theres  not  muchwritten in your record but what there is is enough to hang you     no no hegemon  the arrested man  said  straining  all over in hiswish to  convince  theres  one with a goatskin parchment who  follows mefollows me and keeps writing  all  the  time but once  i  peeked  into thisparchment and was  horrified  i said  decidedly nothing  of whats  writtenthere i implored him  burn your parchment i beg you but he tore it outof my hands and ran away     who is that pilate asked squeamishly and touched his temple with hishand     matthew levi  the prisoner  explained  willingly
heused  to  be  a  tax  collector  and  i  first  met  him  on  the  road  inbethphage where a fig grove juts out at an angle and  i gotto talking with him he treated me hostilely at first and even insulted me that is  thought  he insulted me  by calling me a dog here the prisonersmiled i  personally see nothing bad  about this animal that i should  beoffended by this word        the secretary  stopped writing  and stealthily cast a surprised glancenot at the arrested man but at the procurator        however after listening to me he began to soften yeshua wenton  finally  threw  the  money down  in  the  road  and said  he would  gojourneying with me        pilate grinned  with one cheek baring yellow  teeth and said turninghis whole body towards the secretary     oh city ofyershalaim what does  one not hear in it a tax collectordo you hear threw money down in the road     not  knowing how to reply to that the secretary found it necessary  torepeat pilates smile    
he  said that  henceforth money  had  become hateful to  him  yeshuaexplained matthew levis strange  action and added and since  then  he hasbeen my companion     his teeth still bared the procurator glanced at the arrested man thenat the sun steadily  rising over the equestrian statues  of the hippodromewhich lay far below to the right and  suddenly  in some sickening anguishthought that the  simplest thing would be to drive  this strange  robber offthe balcony by uttering just two words hang him to drive the convoy awayas  well  to leave  the  colonnade  go into  the  palace  order  the roomdarkened  collapse on the  bed  send for cold  water call in a  plaintivevoice  for his  dog banga and complain to him about the hemicrania and thethought of poison suddenly flashed temptingly in the procurators sick head     he gazed  with dull eyes at the arrested man and was silent for a timepainfully trying to  remember  why there stood  before  him in  the pitilessmorning  sunlight of yershalaim 
this prisoner with  his face disfigured  bybeating and what other utterly unnecessary questions he had to ask him     matthew levi the sick  man asked  in  a hoarse voice and closed  hiseyes     yes matthew levi the high tormenting voice came to him     and  what was it in  any case that  you  said  about the temple to thecrowd in the bazaar     the   responding   voice   seemed  to  stab  at  pilates  temple  wasinexpressibly painful and this voice was saying     i said hegemon that the temple of the old faith would fall and a newtemple of truth would be built i  said it that way so  as to make  it  moreunderstandable     and why did you stir up the people in the bazaar you vagrant talkingabout the truth of which you have no notion what is truth     and here the  procurator thought oh  my  gods  im asking him aboutsomething unnecessary at a trial my reason no longer serves me    andagain he pictured a cup of dark liquid poison bring me poison        and again
he heard the voice     the  truth is first of all that your head  aches and aches so  badlythat  youre having  fainthearted thoughts of death youre not only unableto speak to me but it is even hard for you to look at me and i am now yourunwilling torturer which upsets me you cant even think about anything andonly dream  that  your dog should  come  apparently the one being  you  areattached  to  but your suffering will soon  be  over your headache will goaway     the secretary  goggled his  eyes at the prisoner and stopped writing inmidword     pilate raised his tormented eyes to the  prisoner and saw  that the sunalready stood quite high over the hippodrome that a  ray had penetrated thecolonnade and  was stealing  towards yeshuas worn sandals and that the manwas trying to step out of the suns way     here  the  procurator rose  from his chair clutched his  head with hishands  and his  yellowish  shaven face expressed dread  but  he instantlysuppressed it with his will and lowered
himself into his chair again     the prisoner  meanwhile continued his speech but the  secretary was nolonger writing it down and only stretched his neck like a goose trying notto let drop a single word     well  there   its  all  over  the  arrested  man  said  glancingbenevolently  at pilate  and  im  extremely glad  of  it id advise youhegemon  to leave the palace for  a while and go  for a stroll somewhere inthe vicinity  say in the gardens on the mount of  olives astorm  will come       the prisoner turned  narrowing  his eyes at  thesun later on towards evening a stroll would  do  you much good and iwould be  glad to accompany  you certain new thoughts  have occurred to mewhich i think you might find interesting and id willingly  share them withyou the more  so as  you  give the  impression of being a very  intelligentman     the secretary turned deathly pale and dropped the scroll on the floor     the trouble is the  bound man  went on not stopped by anyone
thatyou are too closed  off and have definitively lost faith in people you mustagree  one  cant  place  all  ones  affection  in  a  dog  your  life isimpoverished hegemon and here the speaker allowed himself to smile     the  secretary now  thought of  only one thing whether to  believe hisears or  not he had to believe  then he  tried to  imagine precisely  whatwhimsical form the  wrath of the  hottempered procurator would take at thisunheardof impudence from the prisoner and this the secretary was unable toimagine though he knew the procurator well     then came  the  cracked hoarse  voice of the procurator who  said  inlatin     unbind his hands     one of the  convoy  legionaries rapped with  his  spear handed  it  toanother went over and took the ropes off the prisoner the secretary pickedup his scroll having decided to record nothing for now and to be surprisedat nothing     admit  pilate  asked   softly  in  greek  that  you  are  a  greatphysician     no  procurator 
i  am  not  a  physician   the  prisoner  replieddelightedly rubbing a crimped and swollen purple wrist     scowling deeply  pilate  bored the prisoner with  his eyes and  theseeyes were no longer dull but flashed with sparks familiar to all     i didnt ask you pilate said maybe you also know latin     yes i do the prisoner replied     colour came to pilates yellowish cheeks and he asked in latin     how did you know i wanted to call my dog     its very simple  the prisoner replied  in  latin you  were movingyour hand in the air  and the prisoner  repeated pilates gesture   asif you wanted to stroke something and your lips        yes said pilate     there was silence then pilate asked a question in greek     and so you are a physician     no  no the prisoner  replied  animatedly believe  me  im  not aphysician     very  well  then  if you want to keep it a  secret  do so it has nodirect  bearing on the case so you maintain that you did not incite 
anyoneto destroy  or set fire to or in any other way demolish the temple     i  repeat i did not  incite  anyone to such acts hegemon  do i looklike a halfwit     oh no  you dont look like a halfwit the procurator replied quiedyand smiled some strange smile swear men that it wasnt so     by  what do  you  want  me  to  swear the unbound  man  asked  veryanimated     well  lets  say by  your life  the procurator replied its hightime you swore by it since its hanging by a hair i can tell you     you dont think it was you who hung it hegemon the  prisoner askedif so you are very mistaken     pilate gave a start and replied through his teeth     i can cut that hair     in  that  too you  are  mistaken  the  prisoner  retorted smilingbrightly and  shielding himself from  the sun with his hand you must agreethat surely only he who hung it can cut the hair     so  so  pilate said smiling now i  have no doubts that  the idleloafers of yershalaim
followed at your heels i dont know  who hung  such atongue on you but he hung it  well  incidentally tell me is it true thatyou  entered  yershalaim  by  the  susa  gate  riding  on  anassaccompanied   by  a  crowd  of  riffraff  who  shoutedgreetings to  you as some  kind of  prophet here the procurator pointed tothe parchment scroll     the prisoner glanced at the procurator in perplexity     i dont even have an ass hegemon he said i  did enter  yershalaimby the susa gate but on foot accompanied only by matthew levi and no  oneshouted anything to me because no one in yershalaim knew me then     do you  happen to know pilate continued wimout taking  his  eyes offthe  prisoner such  men  as a certain dysmas another named  gestas and athird named barrabban     i do not know these good people the prisoner replied     truly     truly     and now tell me why is it that you use me words good people all thetime do you call everyone that or what    
everyone the  prisoner  replied  there  are no  evil people  in theworld     the first i hear of it pilate said grinning but perhaps i know toolittle  of  life      you  neednt record  any  more  he addressed thesecretary who had  not recorded  anything anyway and went on  talking withthe prisoner you read that in some greek book     no i figured it out for myself     and you preach it     yes     but  take  for  instance  the  centurion  mark  the  one  known  asratslayer  is he good     yes replied the prisoner true  hes an unhappy man since the goodpeople disfigured him he has  become cruel and hard id be curious to knowwho maimed him     i can willingly tell you that pilate responded for i was a witnessto it the good people  fell on him like dogs on  a bear there were germanfastened  on  his  neck  his  arms  his  legs  the  infantry maniple  wasencircled and if one flank hadnt been  cut by a cavalry turm  of  which iwas  the  commander  
you philosopher would not  have had the  chance tospeak   with    the    ratslayer    that    was   at    the    battle    ofidistaviso in the valley of the virgins     if  i could speak with him the prisoner suddenly said musingly imsure hed change sharply     i dont suppose pilate responded that youd bring  much joy to thelegate  of the  legion  if you decided to talk with any  of  his officers orsoldiers  anyhow its also not going to happen fortunately for  everyoneand i will be the first to see to it     at that moment a  swallow swiftly flitted into the colonnade describeda  circle under the golden ceiling swooped down almost brushed the face ofa bronze statue in a niche with its pointed wing and disappeared behind thecapital of a column it may be that it thought of nesting there     during its flight a formula took shape in the now light and lucid headof the procurator it went  like this the hegemon has looked into  the caseof  the vagrant  philosopher  yeshua  alias
hanozri and  found in  it  nogrounds  for indictment  in  particular  he  has  found  not the slightestconnection between the acts  of  yeshua and  the disorders  that have latelytaken place in yershalaim the vagrant philosopher has proved to be mentallyill consequently the procurator  has not confirmed  the  death sentence onhanozri passed  by the lesser  sanhedrin but  seeing  that hanozris  madutopian talk  might  cause disturbances  in  yershalaim the  procurator  isremoving  yeshua  from yershalaim  and  putting  him  under  confinement  instratonian  caesarea  on the mediterranean    that is precisely  where theprocurators residence was     it remained to dictate it to the secretary     the  swallows wings  whiffled  right over the hegemons head the birddarted to the fountain basin and then flew out into freedom  the procuratorraised his eyes to the prisoner and saw the dust blaze up in a pillar aroundhim     is that all about him pilate asked the secretary     unfortunately not 
the  secretary  replied  unexpectedly  and handedpilate another piece of parchment     whats this now pilate asked and frowned     having  read what had  been handed to him he changed  countenance evenmore  either  the  dark blood rose to his neck  and face or something elsehappened  only his skin  lost its  yellow tinge turned brown and his eyesseemed to sink     again  it  was probably owing to  the blood rising  to his  temples andthrobbing in them only something happened to the procurators vision thushe imagined  that  the prisoners  head floated off  somewhere  and anotherappeared in its place  on this bald head sat a scantpointedgolden diadem on the forehead was a round canker eating into the  skin andsmeared  with  ointment  a  sunken  toothless  mouth  with  a   pendulouscapricious  lower lip  it seemed  to pilate  that  the  pink columns of thebalcony  and the  rooftops  of  yershalaim  far  below  beyond  the gardenvanished  and  everything  was  drowned  in  the thickest 
green  ofcapreangardens and something strange also  happened to  his  hearing it was as iftrumpets sounded  far  away  muted and menacing and a nasal voice was veryclearly heard arrogandy drawling the law of lesemajesty       thoughts raced short incoherent and extraordinary im lost    then were lost      and among them a totally absurd one about  someimmortality which immortality for some reason provoked unendurable anguish     pilate strained  drove  the  apparition away his gaze returned to thebalcony and again the prisoners eyes were before him     listen  hanozri  the procurator spoke looking  at  yeshua somehowstrangely  the procurators face was  menacing but his eyes  were alarmeddid you ever say anything about the  great caesar answer did you     yes  or  no pilate drew  the word no out  somewhat longer  than isdone in  court and his glance sent yeshua some thought that he wished as ifto instil in the prisoner     to speak the truth is easy
and pleasant the prisoner observed     i  have no need to know pilate responded in a stifled angry  voicewhether it is pleasant or  unpleasant for you  to speak the truth you willhave to speak it  anyway  but as you  speak weigh  every word unless youwant a not only inevitable but also painful death     no one  knew what  had happened  with the  procurator of judea but  heallowed  himself to raise his hand as  if to protect  himself from a ray  ofsunlight and  from behind his hand as from behind  a shield to  send  theprisoner some sort of prompting look     answer then he went on speaking do  you know a certain judas fromkiriath and what precisely did you  say to him about caesarif you said anything     it was  like this  the prisoner began  talking eagerly  the eveningbefore  last near the temple i made  the acquaintance  of a young man  whocalled  himself judas from  the town of kiriath he invited me to his placein the lower city and treated me to        a good
man pilate asked and a devilish fire flashed in his eyes     a very  good man and an inquisitive  one the prisoner confirmed heshowed the greatest interest in my thoughts and  received me very cordially     lit the lamps    pilate spoke through his teeth inthe same tone as the prisoner and his eyes glinted     tes yeshua went on slighdy surprised that the procurator was so wellinformed and asked me to give my view of state authority he was extremelyinterested in this question     and what did  you say asked pilate or are you going to reply  thatyouve  forgotten  what  you  said but  there was  already hopelessness inpilates tone     among  other  things  the  prisoner  recounted  i  said  that  allauthority is violence over people and that a time will come when there willbe no authority of  die caesars nor any other authority man will pass intothe kingdom of truth and justice where generally there will be no  need forany authority     go on     i didnt
go on said the  prisoner  here men ran in  bound me andtook me away to prison     the secretary trying not to let drop a single word rapidly traced diewords on his parchment     there never has been is not and never  will be any authority in thisworld  greater or better  for  people  than the  authority  of  the  emperortiberius  pilates  cracked and sick  voice swelled for some  reason  dieprocurator looked at the secretary and the convoy with hatred     and  it is  not for  you insane criminal to  reason about it  herepilate shouted convoy off the balcony and turning to  the secretary headded leave me alone widi the criminal this is a state matter     the convoy raised dieir spears and with a measured  tramp  of hobnailedcaligae  walked off die balcony into the garden and the  secretary followedthe convoy     for some time the  silence on the balcony was broken  only by the watersinging  in  the fountain  pilate saw how  the watery dish blew up over thespout how its edges
broke off how it fell down in streams     the prisoner was the first to speak     i see that some misfortune has come about because  i  talked with thatyoung  man from  kiriath i have a foreboding hegemon that he will come togrief and i am very sorry for him     i think the procurator replied grinning strangely that  there  isnow someone else in the world for whom  you ought to feel  sorrier than forjudas  of kiriath and who is  going to have it much worse than judas   so then mark ratslayer a cold and  convinced torturer die people who asi see the procurator pointed  to  yeshuas disfigured face  beat you foryour  preaching  the robbers  dysmas  and gestas who widi  their confrereskilled four  soldiers and finally the dirty traitor judas  are all goodpeople     yes said the prisoner     and the kingdom of truth will come     it will hegemon yeshua answered with conviction     it will  never come  pilate suddenly cried out in  such  a  terriblevoice that yeshua
drew  back  thus many years before in the valley of thevirgins  pilate  had cried to  his horsemen the words cut them down  cutthem down the giant ratslayer  is trapped  he raised  his  voice crackedwith commanding still more and called out so that his words could be heardin the garden criminal criminal criminal and dien lowering his voicehe asked yeshua hanozri do you believe in any gods     god is one replied yeshua i believe in him     then pray to him pray hard however  here pilates voice gave outthat wont help no wife pilate  asked with anguish for some reason  notunderstanding what was happening to him  no im alone     hateful city    die procurator suddenly muttered for some  reasonshaking his  shoulders as if  he  were cold and rubbing his hands as thoughwashing them if theyd put  a knife in you before your meeting with  judasof kiriath it really would have been better     why  dont you let me go  hegemon the  prisoner asked unexpectedlyand
his voice became anxious i see they want to kill me     a spasm  contorted  pilates face he  turned  to yeshua the  inflamedredveined whites of his eyes and said     do  you  suppose wretch that the roman  procurator will let a man gowho has said what you have said  oh gods gods or  do you think im readyto take your  place i dont share your thoughts and listen to  me if fromthis moment on  you say even one word if you speak to anyone at all bewareof me i repeat to you  beware     hegemon        silence cried pilate and his furious gaze followed the swallow thathad again fluttered on to the balcony to me pilate shouted     and when the secretary and the convoy returned to their  places pilateannounced that he confirmed the death sentence passed at the meeting of  thelesser sanhedrin  on the criminal yeshua  hanozri and the  secretary wrotedown what pilate said     a  moment  later  mark  ratslayer  stood  before  the  procurator  theprocurator ordered him to  hand the 
criminal over to the head of the secretservice along with the procurators directive that yeshua hanozri  was  tobe separated from the other condemned men and also that the soldiers of thesecret service were  to be forbidden on  pain of severe punishment to talkwith yeshua about anything at all or to answer any of his questions     at a  sign  from mark the convoy closed around yeshua and led him fromthe balcony     next  there stood before the  procurator a handsome lightbearded  manwith eagle feathers on the crest of his helmet golden  lions heads shiningon his  chest  and golden plaques on his  sword  belt wearing triplesoledboots  laced  to the knees  and with  a purple cloak  thrown  over his leftshoulder this was the legate in command of the legion     the procurator asked  him where  the sebastean  cohort was stationed atthe  moment  the legate told  him that the sebasteans had cordoned  off thesquare in front of the hippodrome where the sentencing of the criminals wasto be announced
to the people     then the procurator ordered the legate to detach two centuries from theroman cohort one of them under the command of ratslayer was to convoy thecriminals  the  carts  with  the  implements  for  the  execution  and  theexecutioners  as  they were transported to bald mountain andon arrival was to join the upper cordon the other was to be sent at once tobald  mountain and  immediately  start  forming  the  cordon  for  the samepurpose that is to guard the mountain the procurator asked the legate  tosend an auxiliary cavalry regiment  the syrian ala     after the legate left the balcony the procurator ordered the secretaryto summon to the palace the president of the sanhedrin  two of its membersand the head of the temple  guard in yershalaim adding that he asked thingsto be so arranged that  before conferring  with  all these people he  couldspeak with the president previously and alone     the procurators order was executed quickly and precisely and the sunwhich  in  
those  days  was  scorching  yershalaim  with  an  extraordinaryfierceness had not yet had time to approach its highest  point when on theupper terrace of the garden by the two white  marble lions that guarded thestairs a meeting  took place between the  procurator and the man fulfillingthe duties  of  president  of the sanhedrin  the high  priest of the  jewsjoseph kaifa     it  was  quiet in the garden but  when  he  came  out  from under  thecolonnade to the sundrenched upper level  of the garden with its palm treeson monstrous elephant  legs from which  there spread  before the procuratorthe whole of hateful yershalaim with its hanging bridges  fortresses andabove  all that  utterly  indescribable heap  of marble with  golden dragonscales for  a  roof  the temple of yershalaim  the procurators  sharp earcaught far below where  the stone wall separated the lower terraces of thepalace  garden from  the  city square a low rumble over which from  time totime there soared feeble thin moans
or cries     the procurator understood that there on the square a numberless crowdof  yershalaim  citizens  agitated  by  the recent  disorders  had alreadygathered that this  crowd  was waiting impatiently  for the announcement ofthe sentences and that restless water sellers were crying in its midst     the procurator began by inviting the high priest on to  the balcony totake shelter from the merciless heat  but kaifa politely apologizedand  explained  that he  could not do that  on the eve of  the feastpilate  covered  his  slightly  balding  head  with  a  hood and  began  theconversation this conversation took place in greek     pilate said  that  he had looked into  the case of  yeshua hanozri andconfirmed the death sentence     thus three robbers   dysmas gestas and barrabban   and this yeshuahanozri besides  were condemned to be executed and it was to be done thatday the  first two who had ventured to  incite the people to rebel againstcaesar had  been taken  in armed struggle 
by the  roman authorities  wereaccounted  to  the procurator and consequently  would not be talked abouthere but the second  two barrabban and hanozri  had been seized by  thelocal authorities  and  condemned by  the sanhedrin according  to the  lawaccording to custom one of these two criminals had to be released in honourof  the  great feast  of  passover which would  begin that day and so  theprocurator wished to know which  of the two criminals the sanhedrin intendedto set free barrabban or hanozri     kaifa inclined  his head to signify that the question was clear to himand replied     the  sanhedrin asks that barrabban  be released the procurator knewvery  well that the high priest would  give precisely  that answer  but histask consisted in showing that this answer provoked his astonishment     this pilate did with great artfulness  the  eyebrows on  the  arrogantface rose  the  procurator  looked  with amazement straight  into  the highpriests eyes     i confess this answer
stuns  me the procurator  began softly  imafraid there may be some misunderstanding here     pilate explained  himself roman  authority  does  not encroach in  theleast upon  the rights of the  local spiritual authorities  the high priestknows  that very  well but in the present case we are faced with an obviouserror  and  this  error  roman  authority  is  of  course  interested  incorrecting     in fact the crimes of barrabban and hanozri are  quite  incomparablein their  gravity if the latter obviously an  insane person  is guilty ofuttering  preposterous  things in  yershalaim  and  some other  places  theformers burden of guilt is more considerable not only did he allow himselfto  call  directly  for  rebellion but  he also  killed a guard  during theattempt  to  arrest  him barrabban  is  incomparably  more dangerous  thanhanozri     on  the strength of  all  the foregoing the  procurator  asks the highpriest to reconsider the decision  and release the  less harmful of  the twocondemned
men and that is without doubt hanozri and so      kaifa said in  a quiet but firm voice that the sanhedrin had thoroughlyfamiliarized itself with the  case and informed him  a  second  time that itintended to free barrabban     what  even  after my intercession the intercession  of  him  throughwhose person roman authority speaks repeat it a third time high priest     and a  third time i repeat that we are setting barrabban free kaifasaid softly     it was all over and there was nothing more to talk about hanozri wasdeparting  for ever and there was no one to cure the dreadful wicked painsof the procurator there was no remedy for them except death but it was notthis thought which now struck pilate the same incomprehensible anguish thathad already visited him on the balcony  pierced his whole being he tried atonce to explain it and the explanation was a strange one it seemed vaguelyto the procurator that there was something he had not finished saying to thecondemned man and perhaps
something he had not finished hearing     pilate drove this thought away and it flew off as  instantly as it hadcome flying it flew off and the anguish remained unexplained for it couldnot well be explained  by another brief thought that flashed like  lightningand at once went out  immortality    immortality has come    whoseimmortality  had come  that  the  procurator  did not understand  but  thethought of this enigmatic  immortality made  him grow cold in the  scorchingsun     very well said pilate let it be so     here  he turned  gazed  around  at the  world visible to him and  wassurprised  at the change that had taken place the bush laden with roses hadvanished  vanished were the cypresses bordering the upper terrace and  thepomegranate tree and the white statue amidst the greenery and the greeneryitself  in place of it  all there  floated some purple masswater weeds swayed  in it and began moving off somewhere and pilate himselfbegan moving  with them  he was carried
along now smothered and burned bythe most terrible wrath  the wrath of impotence     cramped said pilate i feel cramped     with  a cold  moist hand  he tore at the clasp  on  the  collar of hiscloak and it fell to the sand     its sultry  today theres  a storm  somewhere kaifa responded nottaking his eyes  off the procurators reddened face and  foreseeing all thetorments  that still lay  ahead  he  thought oh what a terrible month ofnisan were having this year     no said pilate its not  because of the sultriness i feel crampedwith you here kaifa and narrowing his eyes pilate smiled and added     watch out for yourself high priest     the high  priests dark eyes  glinted and  with  his face    no  lessartfully than the procurator had done earlier  he expressed amazement     what do i  hear procurator kaifa  replied proudly and calmly  youthreaten me after you yourself have confirmed  the sentence passed can thatbe we are  accustomed to  the
roman procurator choosing his words before hesays something what if we should be overheard hegemon     pilate looked  at the high priest with dead eyes and baring his teethproduced a smile     whats your trouble high priest who can hear us where we are now doyou think im like that young vagrant holy fool who is to be executed todayam i a boy kaifa i know what i say and where i say it there  is a  cordonaround the garden a cordon around the palace so that a  mouse couldnt getthrough any crack not only a mouse but even that one whats his name    from the town of kiriath couldnt get through incidentally high priestdo you know him yes   if that one got  in here hed feel bitterly sorryfor himself in this you will of course  believe me know then that fromnow on high priest you  will have no peace neither you nor your people and pilate pointed far off to  the right where  the  temple blazed  on highit  is  i  who  tell you  so pontius  pilate equestrian  of  the  goldenspear    
i know i  know the  blackbearded kaifa fearlessly replied and hiseyes flashed he raised his arm to heaven and  went  on the  jewish peopleknow  that  you  hate them with  a cruel hatred and  will  cause  them muchsuffering  but you will not destroy them utterly god will protect them hewill hear us the almighty caesar will  hear he will protect us from pilatethe destroyer     oh no pilate exclaimed and  he felt lighter and lighter with everyword there was no more need to pretend  no more  need to choose his wordsfou have complained about me too much to caesar and  now my hour has comekaifa now the message will fly from me and not to the governor in antiochand  not to  rome  but directly  to capreae to  the  emperor  himself themessage of how you in yershalaim  are sheltering known criminals from deathand then it will not be water from  solomons pool that i give yershalaim todrink as i wanted to do for  your own good no not water  remember how onaccount of you i had
to  remove the shields with the emperors insignia fromthe  walls had to  transfer  troops had as you see to come  in person tolook into what goes on with you here remember my words it is  not just onecohort that you will see here in yershalaim  high priest    no the  wholefulminata legion will come under the city  walls  the arabian  cavalry willarrive and then you will hear bitter weeping and wailing you will rememberbarrabban then whom  you saved and  you will  regret having  sent  to hisdeath a philosopher with his peaceful preaching     the high priests face became  covered  with blotches his eyes burnedlike the procurator he smiled baring his teeth and replied     do  you yourself believe what you are saying now procurator  no youdo  not  it is  not peace not  peace  that  the  seducer of the people ofyershalaim  brought us and you equestrian understand that perfectly wellyou wanted to  release him so  that he could disturb the people outrage thefaith and  bring the people
under  roman swords but i the high  priest ofthe  jews  as long  as i live will not allow the faith to be outraged  andwill  protect  the people do  you hear  pilate and  kaifa raised his armmenacingly listen procurator     kaifa fell silent and the procurator again  heard a noise as if of thesea rolling up to  the very  walls of the garden  of  herod  the great thenoise rose  from below to the feet  and into the face of the procurator andbehind  his back  there beyond  the  wings of  the palace  came  alarmingtrumpet calls the  heavy crunch of  hundreds of feet the clanking of ironthe  procurator understood that the roman infantry  was already setting outon  his orders  speeding to the parade of death so terrible for  rebels androbbers     do  you hear  procurator the high priest repeated quietly are yougoing to tell me that all this  here the high priest raised  both arms andthe dark hood  fell from his head  has been caused by the wretched  robberbarrabban     the procurator
wiped his  wet cold forehead with the back of his handlooked at the ground then squinting at the sky saw  that the redhot ballwas almost over his head and that kaifas  shadow  had shrunk to  nothing bvthe lions tail and said quietly and indifferently     its nearly noon  we got carried away by our conversation and yet wemust proceed     having apologized in refined terms  before  the high priest he invitedhim to sit down on a  bench in  the shade  of  a magnolia and  wait until hesummoned the other persons needed for the last brief conference and gave onemore instruction connected with the execution     kaifa bowed  politely placing his hand on  his heart  and stayed irirthe  garden  while  pilate  returned  to  the  balcony there  he  told  thesecretary who had been  waiting for him to invite to the garden the legateof the legion and the  tribune of the cohort  as well as the two members ofthe  sanhedrin and the  head  of the temple guard who had been awaiting hissummons on the lower garden
terrace  in a round gazebo with a  fountain tothis pilate added that he himself would come out to the  garden at once andwithdrew into the palace     while  the secretary was gathering the conference the procurator  metin a room shielded  from the sun by dark curtains with a certain man whoseface was half covered  by a hood though he could not have been  bothered bythe  suns  rays in  this  room  the  meeting was a  very  short  one  theprocurator quietly spoke a few words to the man after which he withdrew andpilate walked out through the colonnade to the garden     there  in  the  presence  of  all  those he  had desired to  see  theprocurator solemnly and drily stated that he confirmed the death sentence onyeshua hanozri and officially inquired  of the members of the sanhedrin asto  whom among  the criminals they would like to grant life having receivedthe reply that it was barrabban the procurator said     very well and told the  secretary to put it into the record at  onceclutched 
in  his hand  the clasp that the secretary had picked up from  thesand and said solemnly tt is time     here  all those present started down  the wide marble stairway  betweenwalls of  roses that exuded  a  stupefying aroma descending lower and lowertowards the palace wall to the gates opening  on to the big smoothly pavedsquare  at the end  of  which could be seen the columns and statues  of theyershalaim stadium     as soon as the group entered the square from the garden and mounted thespacious stone platform that dominated the  square pilate  looking  aroundthrough narrowed eyelids assessed the situation     the  space  he  had just traversed that is the space  from the palacewall to the platform  was empty but before him pilate could no longer  seethe square  it had been swallowed up  by the crowd which would have pouredover the platform and the cleared space as well had it not been kept at bayby a triple  row of sebastean soldiers to the left of pilate and soldiers ofthe auxiliary iturean
cohort to his right     and so pilate mounted the platform mechanically clutching the uselessclasp in his fist and squinting  his eyes  the procurator was squinting notbecause the sun burned  his eyes  no for some  reason  he did not want tosee the group  of  condemned  men who  as he knew perfectly well were  nowbeing brought on to the platform behind him     as soon as the white cloak with crimson lining appeared  high up on thestone cliff over the verge of the human sea the unseeing  pilate was struckin the ears bv a wave of  sound  haaa    it started mutedly arisingsomewhere  far away  by the hippodrome  then  became thunderous and havingheld out  for  a few  seconds began  to  subside  theyve  seen  me  theprocurator  thought the  wave  had  not reached its  lowest point before itstarted  swelling  again  unexpectedly  and swaying rose higher  than  thefirst and as foam boils up on the billows of the sea so a whistling boiledup on this second wave and separate distinguishable
from the  thunder thewails  of women theyve been led on to the platform thought pilate  andthe wails mean that several women got crushed as the crowd surged forward     he waited for some  time knowing that no power could silence the crowdbefore it exhaled all that was pent up in it and fell silent of itself     and when this moment  came the procurator threw up his  right arm andthe last noise was blown away from the crowd     then pilate drew into his breast as much of the hot air as he could andshouted and his cracked voice carried over thousands of heads     in the name of the emperor caesar        here  his ears were struck several times by  a  clipped iron shout thecohorts of soldiers  raised high their spears and standards and shouted  outterribly     long live caesar     pilate lifted  his face and thrust it straight into the sun green fireflared  up behind his  eyelids  his brain took  flame from  it  and hoarsearamaic words went flying over the crowd     four  criminals 
arrested  in yershalaim  for murder  incitement  torebellion and  outrages against the laws and the faith have been sentencedto a  shameful  execution    by hanging on posts and  this  execution willpresently be carried out on  bald mountain the  names of  the criminals aredysmas gestas barrabban and hanozri here they stand before you     pilate pointed to his right not seeing any criminals but knowing theywere there in place where they ought to be     the  crowd responded with a  long rumble as if of surprise  or  reliefwhen it died down pilate continued     but only three  of them will be executed for in accordance with  lawand custom in honour of the feast of passover to  one of the condemned aschosen  by  the  lesser sanhedrin  and  confirmed  by  roman authority  themagnanimous emperor caesar will return his contemptible life     pilate cried out the words and at the same time listened as the  rumblewas replaced by a great silence not a sigh not  a  rustle reached his earsnow
and there was even a moment  when  it  seemed to pilate that everythingaround  him had vanished altogether the hated  city died  and  he alone isstanding there scorched  by the sheer  rays  his face set against the skypilate held the silence a little longer and then began to cry out     the name of  the one who will now be set free before  you is    hemade one more pause holding back the name making  sure  he  had  said allbecause  he knew that the dead  city would  resurrect  once the name  of thelucky  man  was spoken and  no further  words would be heard all pilatewhispered soundlessly to himself  all the  name and rolling the letterr over the silent city he cried     barrabban     here it  seemed  to  him that the sun  clanging  burst  over  him andflooded his ears  with  fire  this fire raged  with  roars shrieks wailsguffaws and whistles     pilate  turned  and walked  back across the  platform  to  the  stairslooking at nothing  except the multicoloured  squares
of the flooring  underhis feet so as not to trip  he knew that behind his back  the platform wasbeing showered with bronze coins dates that people in the howling mob wereclimbing on shoulders  crushing  each  other to see the miracle with theirown eyes  how a man already in the grip of death escaped that grip how thelegionaries take the ropes off him involuntarily causing  him  burning painin  his  arms dislocated during  his  interrogation  how  he wincing  andgroaning nevertheless smiles a senseless crazed smile     he knew that at the same time the convoy was already leading the  threemen with bound arms to the side stairs so as to take them to the road goingwest  from  the  city  towards  bald  mountain  only  when he was  off theplatform to the rear of  it did pilate open his eyes knowing  that he wasnow safe  he could no longer see the condemned men     mingled with the wails of the quieting crowd  yet distinguishable fromthem were the piercing cries of heralds repeating  some in
aramaic othersin greek  all that  the procurator had cried out from the platform besidesthat there came to his ears the tapping clattering and approaching thud ofhoofs  and  a trumpet calling  out something brief and merry these  soundswere  answered by the drilling whistles of bovs on the roofs of houses alongthe street that led from the bazaar to  the hippodrome  square and by criesof look out     a soldier  standing alone in the cleared space of  the  square  with astandard  in his hand  waved it anxiously  and  then  the  procurator thelegate of the legion the secretary and the convoy stopped     a cavalry  ala at an everlengthening  trot flew out into the squareso as to cross it at one side bypassing the mass of people and ride down alane under a stone  wall  covered with  creeping vines taking the  shortestroute to bald mountain     at a  flying trot small as a boy dark as a mulatto the commander  ofthe ala a syrian  coming abreast  of pilate  shouted something in a  highvoice
and snatched his sword  from  its  sheath the  angry sweating  blackhorse  shied and reared  thrusting his sword  back  into  its  sheath  thecommander struck the horses  neck with his crop brought him down and rodeoff  into  the lane breaking  into a gallop  after him  three  by  threehorsemen flew in  a cloud  of  dust the  tips  of their light bamboo lancesbobbing  and faces dashed past  the procurator  looking especially swarthyunder their white turbans  with merrily bared gleaming teeth     raising dust to  the sky the ala  burst into the lane and the last toride past pilate  was a soldier with a trumpet slung on his back blazing inthe sun     shielding himself from the dust with his hand  and  wrinkling his  facediscontentedly  pilate started  on in  the  direction  of  the gates to thepalace garden and after him came the legate the secretary and the convoy     it was around ten oclock in the morning

chapter 3 the seventh proof      yes  it was  around  ten  oclock in  the morning my  esteemed  ivannikolaevich said the professor     the poet passed his  hand over his face like a man  just coming to  hissenses and saw that it  was  evening at the patriarchs ponds the water inthe pond had turned black and a light boat was  now gliding on it  and onecould hear  the splash of oars  and the  giggles of some  citizeness  in thelittle  boat the public appeared on the benches  along the walks but againon  the other  three  sides  of  the square  and not on the side where  ourinterlocutors were     the sky over moscow seemed to lose colour and the  full moon could  beseen  quite  distinctly high above  not yet  golden but white it  was mucheasier  to breathe  and the voices  under the lindens  now sounded  softereveningish     how  is it i didnt notice that hed  managed to spin a whole story   homeless thought in amazement its already evening   or maybe  hewasnt telling it but i simply fell asleep and
dreamed it all     but  it must be supposed that the  professor  did tell  the story afterall otherwise it  would  have to be assumed that  berlioz had had  the samedream because he said studying the foreigners face attentively     your story is  extremely  interesting  professor  though it does notcoincide at all with the gospel stories     good heavens  the professor responded smiling condescendingly youof all people  should know that precisely nothing of  what is written in thegospels ever  actually took place  and if we start referring to the gospelsas  a historical  source       he  smiled once more and berlioz stoppedshort because  this was  literally the same thing  he  had been  saying  tohomeless as they walked down bronnaya towards the patriarchs ponds     thats so berlioz replied but im afraid no one can  confirm  thatwhat youve just told us actually took place either     oh yes that there is one who can the professor beginning to speakin  broken  language 
said  with  great  assurance  and   with  unexpectedmysteriousness he motioned the two friends to move closer     they leaned towards him from both sides and he said but again withoutany accent which with him devil knows why now appeared now disappeared     the thing is   here the professor looked around fearfully and spokein a  whisper that  i was personally present at  it  all i was on pontiuspilates balcony and in the  garden when  he talked  with kaifa and on theplatform  only  secredy incognito so to speak  and therefore i beg you not a word to anyone total secrecy shh        silence fell and berlioz paled     you    how long have you been in  moscow he asked in a  quaveringvoice     i just  arrived  in  moscow  this  very  minute the  professor  saidperplexedly and only here  did it occur to the friends to take a  good lookin  his eyes at which they  became  convinced that his left  eye the greenone was totally insane while the right one was empty black and
dead     theres   the  whole   explanation  for  you  berlioz   thought   inbewilderment a mad german has turned up or  just went crazy at the pondswhat a story     yes indeed that explained the whole thing the most strange breakfastwith  the  late philosopher kant the foolish talk about  sunflower  oil andannushka the  predictions about his  head being cut off and all the rest  the professor was mad     berlioz  realized  at once  what had  to  be done leaning  back on thebench he winked  to  homeless behind the professors back   meaning dontcontradict him  but the perplexed poet did not understand these signals     yes  yes  yes  berlioz  said  excitedly  incidentally  its  allpossible    even very  possible pontius pilate and the balcony  and soforth    did you come alone or with your wife     alone alone im always alone the professor replied bitterly     and where  are  your things professor  berlioz asked insinuatinglyat the metropol where are you
staying     i   nowhere  the  halfwitted  german  answered his  green  eyewandering in wild anguish over the patriarchs ponds     hows that but   where are you going to live     in your apartment the madman suddenly said brashly and winked     i  im  very  glad  berlioz began  muttering but really youwont be comfortable at my place    and they have  wonderful rooms at themetropol its a firstclass hotel     and theres no  devil either the sick man  suddenly inquired merrilyof ivan nikolaevich     no devil       dont contradict him berlioz whispered with his  lips only droppingbehind the professors back and making faces     there isnt  any  devil ivan nikolaevich  at a loss  from  all  thisbalderdash cried out  not what he ought  what a punishment  stop playingthe psycho     here the insane man burst into such laughter that a sparrow flew out ofthe linden over the seated mens heads     well now that is positively interesting the professor
said shakingwith  laughter what is it  with you   no matter what one asks for  thereisnt  any he suddenly stopped  laughing  and quite understandably for  amentally ill person  fell into the opposite extreme after  laughing becamevexed and cried sternly so you mean there just simply isnt any     calm down calm  down calm  down professor  berlioz  muttered forfear of  agitating the  sick  man  you sit here for a  little minute  withcomrade homeless  and ill just run to the comer to  make a phone call andthen well take you wherever you like you dont know the city        berliozs plan must be  acknowledged as correct  he had  to run to thenearest public  telephone  and  inform the  foreigners bureau thus and sotheres some consultant  from abroad sitting at  the patriarchs ponds in anobviously abnormal  state so it was  necessary  to take measures lest someunpleasant nonsense result     to make a call well then make your call the sick man  agreed sadlyand suddenly begged 
passionately but  i  implore  you before you go  atleast believe that the devil exists i no  longer ask you for anything moremind you there exists a seventh proof of  it  the surest of all and it isgoing to be presented to you right now     very good very good berlioz said with false tenderness and winkingto  the upset poet who  did  not relish at all the idea of guarding the madgerman set out for  the exit from the ponds at the  comer  of  bronnaya andyermolaevsky lane     and the professor seemed to recover his health and brighten up at once     mikhail alexandrovich he shouted after berlioz     the  latter gave  a start looked back but reassured  himself with thethought that  the  professor had also  learned his name and patronymic  fromsome newspaper     then the professor called out cupping his hands like a megaphone     would  you  like  me to have  a telegram sent at once to your uncle inkiev     and again berlioz winced how does  the madman know about the existenceof  a 
kievan  uncle  that  has  certainly  never  been  mentioned  in  anynewspapers ohoh maybe homeless is right after all and suppose his papersare  phoney  ah  what a  strange  specimen   call call call  at oncetheyll quickly explain him     and no longer listening to anything berlioz ran on     here just at the exit to bronnaya there rose from a bench to meet theeditor exactly the  same citizen  who in  the  sunlight  earlier had  formedhimself out of the thick swelter only now he was no longer made of air butordinary  fleshly  and berlioz  clearly  distinguished  in  the  beginningtwilight that he  had  a little moustache like  chicken feathers tiny eyesironic and half drunk and  checkered trousers pulled  up so  high that  hisdirty white socks showed     mikhail alexandrovich  drew back  but reassured himself  by reflectingthat it  was  a stupid coincidence and that generally  there was no  time tothink about it now     looking for the turnstile  citizen the checkered type inquired
in acracked  tenor this way  please straight on and  youll  get where youregoing how  about  a little  pint pot  for my  information   to set up anexchoirmaster   mugging the specimen swept his jockeys cap from  hishead     berlioz  not  stopping  to   listen   to   the  cadging  and  clowningchoirmaster  ran up to the turnstile and took hold of it with his hand heturned it and was just about  to step across  the  rails when  red and whitelight  splashed  in  his face  a  sign  lit up  in  a  glass box  cautiontramcar     and right then this tramcar came racing along turning down the  newlylaid line  from yermolaevsky to bronnaya having  turned  and coming to thestraight stretch it suddenly  lit  up inside  with electricity whined andput on speed     the prudent berlioz though he was standing in a safe place decided toretreat behind the stile moved his hand on  the crossbar and stepped backand right then his hand slipped and slid one foot unimpeded as if on icewent down
the cobbled slope leading to the rails the other  was thrust intothe air and berlioz was thrown on to the rails     trying to get hold of  something berlioz  fell backwards the back  ofhis head  lightly striking the cobbles and had time  to see high up   butwhether to right or  left he  no  longer knew   the  goldtinged moon  hemanaged  to turn on his  side at  the same moment drawing his  legs  to hisstomach  in  a frenzied movement and while turning to make out the  facecompletely white with horror and the  crimson armband  of the  woman driverbearing down on him  with irresistible  force berlioz did not cry  out butaround him the whole street screamed with desperate female voices     the woman driver tore at the  electric brake the car dug its nose intothe ground then instantly jumped up and glass flew from the windows with acrash and a jingle here someone in berliozs brain cried  desperately canit be   once more and for  the  last time the  moon  flashed but nowbreaking to
pieces and then it became dark     the tramcar went over berlioz and  a round dark object was  thrown upthe  cobbled  slope below the fence  of the patriarchs walk  having rolledback down this slope it went bouncing along the cobblestones of the street     it was the severed head of berlioz

chapter 4 the chase      the hysterical womens cries  died  down the police  whistles  stoppeddrilling two ambulances drove off  one with the headless body and severedhead to the morgue the other  with the beautiful driver wounded by brokenglass street sweepers in  white  aprons removed the broken glass and pouredsand on the pools of blood but ivan nikolaevich just stayed on the bench ashe had dropped on  to  it before reaching the turnstile  he  tried  severaltimes to get  up  but  his  legs would not  obey him   something akin  toparalysis had occurred with homeless     the  poet  had  rushed to the  turnstile as soon  as he heard the firstscream and had seen the head go  bouncing along the  pavement with that heso lost his  senses that having  dropped on  to the  bench he bit his handuntil it bled of course he forgot about the mad german and tried to figureout one  thing only  how it  could be that he  had just  been  talking withberlioz and a moment later  the head        agitated  people went
running down the  walk past  the poet exclaimingsomething but ivan nikolaevich was  insensible to their words however twowomen  unexpectedly  ran  into  each  other  near  him  and  one  of  themsharpnosed and bareheaded shouted the following to the other  right nextto the poets ear         annushka our annushka from sadovaya its her work     shebought  sunflower  oil  at  the  grocery  and  went  and  broke  the  wholelitrebottle on the turnstile messed her skirt all up and swore and swore  and he poor man must have slipped and  right on to the rails       of  all  that  the  woman  shouted  one  word lodged  itself  in  ivannikolaevichs upset brain annushka      annushka    annushka the poet muttered looking around anxiouslywait a minute wait a minute        the word annushka got strung together with the words sunflower oiland then for some reason with pondus pilate the poet dismissed pilate andbegan unking up the  chain that started from the
word  annushka and  thischain got very quickly linked up and led at once to the mad professor     excuse  me  but he  did  say the meeting wouldnt take  place becauseannushka  had spilled the oil  and  if you please  it wont  take  placewhats more he said straight out that  berliozs head would be cut off by awoman yes yes yes and the driver was a woman what is all this eh     there was not a grain of doubt left that the mysterious consultant  hadknown  beforehand the  exact  picture of the terrible death of berlioz heretwo  thoughts  pierced the  poets brain  the first hes not mad  in  theleast  thats all  nonsense and the  second then didnt he set it all uphimself     but in  what manner may we  ask  ah no  this were  going to findout     making  a  great  effort ivan nikolaevich  got up from the  bench  andrushed  back  to  where  he  had  been  talking  with  the  professor  andfortunately it turned out that the man had not left yet     the street lights were 
already lit on bronnaya and over the ponds thegolden moon shone and in the everdeceptive  light of the moon it seemed toivan nikolaevich that he  stood holding a sword not a  walking stick underhis arm     the exchoirmaster was sitting in the very place where ivan nikolaevichhad sat just recently now the busybody had perched on his nose an obviouslyunnecessary pincenez in  which  one  lens was missing  altogether and  theother was cracked this  made the checkered citizen even more repulsive thanhe had been when he showed berlioz the way to the rails     with a chill in his heart ivan approached the professor  and glancinginto  his face  became convinced that there were not and never had been anysigns of madness in that face     confess who are you ivan asked in a hollow voice     the foreigner  scowled looked at the poet as if he were seeing him forthe first time and answered inimically     no understand  no speak russian      the gent dont understand the  choirmaster mixed in
from  the  benchthough no one had asked him to explain the foreigners words     dont pretend ivan said threateningly and  felt cold in  the pit ofhis stomach you spoke excellent russian just now youre not a  german andyoure not a professor youre a murderer and a spy   your papers ivancried fiercely     the mysterious  professor  squeamishly  twisted his  mouth  which  wastwisted to begin with then shrugged his shoulders     citizen  the  loathsome  choirmaster  butted in again whatre  youdoing bothering a foreign tourist for that youll incur severe punishment     and the suspicious professor made  an arrogant face turned and walkedaway from  ivan ivan felt himself  at a  loss breathless he addressed thechoirmaster     hey citizen help me to detain the criminal its your duty     the  choirmaster   became  extraordinarily  animated  jumped   up  andhollered     what  criminal  where is he  a foreign criminal the  choirmasterseyes sparkled gleefully that
one if hes a criminal the first thing to dois shout help or  else hell get away come on together  now one two and here the choirmaster opened his maw     totally  at a  loss ivan  obeyed the trickster and shouted help butthe choirmaster bluffed him and did not shout anything     ivans solitary hoarse cry did not produce any good results two girlsshied away from him and he heard the word drunk     ah so youre in with him ivan  cried out waxing  wroth  what areyou doing jeering at me out of my way     ivan  dashed  to  the right and so did the choirmaster ivan dashed tothe left and the scoundrel did the same     getting  under  my feet  on purpose  ivan  cried turning ferociousill hand you over to the police     ivan attempted  to grab  the blackguard  by the sleeve  but missed andcaught precisely nothing it  was  as  if the  choirmaster  fell through theearth     ivan gasped looked into the distance and saw the hateful stranger hewas already
at the exit to patriarchs lane moreover he was not alone themore than dubious choirmaster had  managed to join  him but  that was stillnot all the third in this company proved  to be a tomcat who appeared outof nowhere huge as a hog black as soot or  as a rook and with a desperatecavalrymans  whiskers  the trio  set  off down  patriarchs lane  the catwalking on his hind legs     ivan  sped after  the  villains  and became convinced at once that it would be very difficult to catch up with them     the  trio  shot  down  the  lane  in  an  instant   and  came   out  onspiridonovka no  matter how ivan quickened his pace  the distance betweenhim  and his  quarry  never  diminished  and  before the poet  knew  it heemerged after the quiet of spiridonovka by  the  nikitsky gate  where hissituation worsened the place was swarming with people besides the gang ofvillains decided to apply the favourite  trick of  bandits here a scatteredgetaway     the choirmaster  with great  dexterity 
bored  his  way  on  to a busspeeding towards the arbat square and slipped  away having lost  one of hisquarry ivan focused his attention on the cat and saw this strange cat go upto the footboard  of an a tram waiting at a stop brazenly elbow  aside  awoman who screamed grab hold of the handrail and even make an  attempt toshove  a tenkopeck  piece into the conductresss hand through  the  windowopen on account of the stuffiness     ivan was so struck by the cats  behaviour that he froze motionless  bythe  grocery store on the corner and here he was struck for a second  timebut much  more strongly by the conductresss behaviour as  soon as she sawthe cat getting into the tramcar she shouted with a  malice that even madeher shake     no cats allowed nobody with cats allowed scat get off or ill callthe police     neither the conductress nor  the passengers were struck by the  essenceof the matter not just that a cat was boarding a tramcar which would havebeen good enough but that he
was going to pay     the cat turned out  to be  not only  a solvent  but also  a disciplinedanimal at the very first shout from the conductress he halted his advancegot off  the footboard and sat down at the stop rubbing his whiskers  withthe tenkopeck piece but as soon as the conductress yanked the cord and thetramcar started moving off the cat acted like anyone who has been expelledfrom a tramcar but sail needs a ride letting all three cars go by the catjumped on to the rear couplingpin of the last one wrapped its paws  aroundsome hose sticking out of  the side and rode off  thus  saving himself tenkopecks     occupied with  the obnoxious  cat ivan almost lost the main one of thethree  the professor  but fortunately the man had not managed  to  slipaway ivan saw the  grey  beret  in  the  throng  at  the  head  of bolshayanikitskaya now herzen  street in the  twinkling of an  eye  ivan arrivedthere  himself however he  had no luck  the poet would quicken  his pacebreak into a
trot shove  passersby  yet  not  get an inch closer  to  theprofessor     upset as he was ivan was still struck by the supernatural speed of thechase twenty seconds had not gone by  when  after the  nikitsky gate ivannikolaevich was  already  dazzled by the lights of the arbat square anotherfew seconds and here was some dark lane with slanting sidewalks where ivannikolaevich  took a tumble and hurt his knee again a litup  thoroughfare kropotkin street  then a lane then ostozhenka then another  lane dismalvile and sparsely lit  and  it was here that  ivan nikolaevich definitivelylost him whom he needed so much the professor disappeared     ivan nikolaevich was  perplexed  but not for long because he suddenlyrealized that the professor must unfailingly be  found in house  no 15 andmost assuredly in apartment 47     bursting  into  the  entrance ivan  nikolaevich flew up to the  secondfloor immediately found the  apartment  and rang impatiently  he did  nothave to wait  long some little
girl of about five opened the  door for ivanand without asking him anything immediately went away somewhere     in  the huge extremely neglected front  hall weakly  lit  by  a  tinycarbon arc lamp  under the high ceiling black with grime a bicycle withouttyres hung on the wall a huge ironbound trunk stood and  on  a shelf overthe coat rack a winter hat  lay its long earflaps hanging down behind oneof  the doors a resonant male voice was angrily shouting something in versefrom a radio set     ivan  nikolaevich  was  not  the least at  a  loss  in  the  unfamiliarsurroundings  and rushed  straight  into  the corridor reasoning  thus ofcourse  hes hiding in the bathroom the corridor was  dark having bumpedinto the wall  a few times ivan saw  a faint streak of light under a  doorfelt for the handle  and pulled  it  gendy  the  hook popped out and ivanfound himself precisely in the bathroom and thought how lucky he was     however his luck was not all it might have been ivan met  with
a waveof humid heat and by the light of the coals smouldering in the boiler madeout  big  basins  hanging  on the walls and a bath tub all black frightfulblotches where  the enamel  had  chipped off and there  in  this bath tubstood a naked  cidzeness  all soapy  and  with  a scrubber in her hand shesquinted nearsightedly at the burstingin ivan and obviously mistaking himin the infernal light said sofdy and gaily     kiriushka stop this  tomfoolery have you lost your mind   fyodorivanych will be back any minute get out  right now and  she waved at ivanwith the scrubber     the  misunderstanding was evident and ivan nikolaevich was of courseto  blame  for  it  but  he  did  not  want  to admit  it  and  exclaimingreproachfully ah  wanton creature  at once  found himself for  somereason  in  the  kitchen  no  one  was  there  and  on  the  oven  in  thesemidarkness silently stood about  a dozen extinguished primuses a singlemoonbeam  having  seeped through  the  dusty 
perennially unwashed windowshone sparsely  into the corner where in dust and cobwebs a forgotten iconhung  with the ends  of two wedding candlespeeking out  frombehind its casing  under the big icon pinned to it hung a little one madeof paper     no one  knows what thought took hold of  ivan  here but before runningout the  back door he appropriated  one of these  candles  as well as  thepaper icon  with  these objects he  left the unknown  apartment mutteringsomething embarrassed at the thought of what he had just experienced in thebathroom involuntarily trying to guess who this impudent kiriushka might beand whether the disgusting hat with earflaps belonged to him     in the desolate joyless lane the poet looked around searching for thefugitive but he was nowhere to be seen then ivan said firmly to himself     why of course hes at the moscow river onward     someone ought perhaps to have  asked ivan nikolaevich why he supposedthat the professor was precisely at the  moscow
river  and not in some otherplace but the trouble was that there was no one to ask  him  the loathsomelane was completely empty     in  the  very shortest time ivan  nikolaevich could  be  seen  on  thegranite steps of the moscow river amphitheatre     having  taken off his  clothes  ivan  entrusted  them  to  a pleasantbearded fellow  who  was smoking a handrolled cigarette sitting  beside  atorn white tolstoy blouse and a pair  of unlaced  worn boots  after wavinghis arms to cool off ivan dived swallowfashion into the water     it took his breath away so  cold the water  was  and the thought evenflashed in him  that he might not manage to come up to the surface howeverhe did manage to come  up and puffing  and  snorting his eyes  rounded interror  ivan  nikolaevich began  swimming  through the  black oilsmellingwater among the broken zigzags of street lights on the bank     when the wet ivan came dancing back up the steps to the place where thebearded fellow was guarding his clothes 
it became clear that not  only thelatter but also the former  that is the bearded fellow himself  had beenstolen  in  the exact spot where the  pile of clothes  had been a  pair ofstriped drawers the torn tolstoy blouse the candle the icon and a  box ofmatches had  been left after  threatening someone in the  distance with hisfist in powerless anger ivan put on what was left for him     here two  considerations began to trouble him first that his massolitidentification  card  which he never parted with was  gone  and  secondwhether he could  manage to get through moscow unhindered looking the way hedid now in striped drawers after all  true it was  nobodys  businessbut still there might be some hitch or delay     ivan tore  off  the  buttons where the drawers  fastened at the  anklefiguring that  this way they might pass for summer trousers gathered up theicon the candle and the matches and started off saying to himself     to griboedovs beyond all doubt hes there     the
city was already living its  evening life  trucks flew through thedust chains clanking and on  their platforms men lay sprawled  belly up onsacks all windows  were open in each of these windows a light burned underan orange lampshade and from every window every door every gateway roofand attic basement  and  courtyard blared the hoarse roar of the  polonaisefrom the opera evgeny onegin     ivan nikolaevichs apprehensions proved fully justified passersby didpay  attention  to him  and  turned their heads  as  a result he  took thedecision to  leave  the  main streets  and  make his way through back laneswhere people are not so importunate where there were fewer chances  of thempicking on a  barefoot man pestering him with questions about  his drawerswhich stubbornly refused to look like trousers     this ivan did and  penetrating the mysterious network of lanes aroundthe arbat he began making his way along the walls casting fearful sidelongglances turning around every moment hiding
in gateways frori time to timeavoiding  intersections  with  traffic  lights and  the  grand  entrances ofembassy mansions     and all along his difficult way  he was for some  reason inexpressiblytormented by the  ubiquitous  orchestra  that accompanied  the  heavy  bassosinging about his love for tatiana

chapter 5 there were doings at griboedovs      the  old  twostoreyed  creamcoloured  house   stood   on  the  ringboulevard in the depths of a seedy garden separated from the sidewalk by afancy castiron fence  the small  terrace in front of the  house  was pavedwith asphalt and in wintertime was dominated by a  snow pile with  a shovelstuck in it but in summertime turned into  the most  magnificent section ofthe summer restaurant under a canvas tent     the house was called  the house of  griboedov on the  grounds that itwas  alleged  to have  once  belonged  to  an  aunt of the writer  alexandersergeevich griboedov now whether it did or did not belong toher we do not  exactly know on recollection  it even seems that griboedovnever had any  such houseowning  aunt    nevertheless that was what thehouse was called moreover one moscow liar had it that there on the secondfloor in a round hall with columns  the famous writer  had supposedly readpassages  from woe from wit to this very  aunt while she reclined on a sofahowever
devil knows maybe he did its of no importance     what is important is that at the  present time this house was owned  bythat  same  massolit  which had  been  headed  by  the  unfortunate  mikhailalexandrovich berlioz before his appearance at the patriarchs ponds     in the casual manner  of massolit  members no one called the house thehouse of griboedov everyone simply said griboedovs i spent two  hoursyesterday knocking  about griboedovs well and so got  myself a monthin yalta bravo or go to berlioz he receives today from four to  fiveat griboedovs    and so on     massolit had settled itself at griboedovs in the  best and cosiest wayimaginable  anyone entering  griboedovs  first of all became involuntarilyacquainted with the announcements of various sports clubs and with group aswell  as  individual  photographs of the members of massolit  hanging  thephotographs on the walls of the staircase leading to the second floor     on the door to  the very first room of this
upper floor one could see abig sign fishing and vacation section  along with the  picture of a carpcaught on a line     on  the  door  of room  no 2  something not  quite  comprehensible waswritten oneday creative trips apply to m v spurioznaya     the  next   door  bore  a   brief  but  now  totally   incomprehensibleinscription perelygino after which  the  chance visitor togriboedovs would not know where to look from the motley inscriptions on theaunts walnut  doors  sign  up  for  paper  with  poklevkina  cashierpersonal accounts of sketchwriters       if one cut through the longest line which already went downstairs  andout to the doormans lodge one could see  the sign  housing question on adoor which people were crashing every second     beyond  the housing  question  there  opened out  a luxurious poster onwhich a cliff was  depicted and riding  on its crest a horseman  in a feltcloak with  a  rifle on his  shoulder  a little lower   palm  trees and abalcony

startgnawing at him and he would immediately address bitter reproaches to heavenfor not having endowed  him  at birth  with  literary  talent lacking whichthere was naturally no dreaming of owning a massolit membership card brownsmelling of costly leather with  a wide gold border  a card known  to allmoscow     who will speak in  defence of  envy this  feeling belongs to the nastycategory but all the  same one must  put oneself in the visitors positionfor what he  had seen on the upper floor was not all and  was far from allthe entire  ground  floor of the  aunts house was occupied by a restaurantand what a restaurant it was justly considered  the best in moscow and notonly because it  took up two vast  halls with arched ceilings painted  withviolet assyrianmaned horses not only because on each  table there stood alamp  shaded with  a shawl  not only because it was  not accessible to justanybody coming in  off the  street but because in the  quality of its  faregriboedovs beat any restaurant
in moscow up  and down  and  this fare  wasavailable at the most reasonable by no means onerous price     hence  there was nothing  surprising for  instance in  the  followingconversation which  the author of these most truthful lines once heard nearthe castiron fence of griboedovs     where are you dining today amvrosy     what  a  question why  here of  course  my  dear  foka  archibaldarchibaldovich  whispered  to me today  that  there will be perch au natureldone to order a virtuoso little treat     you  sure know how to  live amvrosy skinny rundown foka  with  acarbuncle  on his  neck  replied  with a sigh to  the  ruddylipped  giantgoldenhaired plumpcheeked amvrosythepoet     i  have  no special knowledge amvrosy  protested just the ordinarywish to  live like a  human being you  mean to say foka that perch can bemet with  at  the coliseum  as well but at the  coliseum a portion of perchcosts thirteen roubles fifteen kopecks and here   fivefifty besides

on  a white stool witha shiny foot  not  in a madhouse but in a clinic where no  one will keepyou if its not necessary     ivan nikolaevich glanced at  him mistrustfully out of the  comer of hiseye but still grumbled     thank the lord one normal man has finally turned up among the idiotsof whom the first is that giftless goof sashka     who is this giftless sashka the doctor inquired     this one here  riukhin ivan  replied  jabbing his  dirty finger inriukhins direction     the latter  flushed with  indignation  thats the  thanks  i get  hethought bitterly for showing concern for him what trash really     psychologically   a   typical   little   kulak   ivannikolaevich began  evidently from an irresistible urge to denounce riukhinand  whats  more  a  little  kulak  carefully  disguising  himself as  aproletarian  look  at his  lenten physiognomy  and  compare it with  thoseresounding verses he wrote for the first of  may   heh  hehheh  soaring up
and soaring down but  if you could look inside himand  see what  he thinks   youd  gasp and ivan nikolaevich burst  intosinister laughter     riukhin  was  breathing heavily turned  red  and  thought of just onething that he had warmed a serpent on his breast that he had shown concernfor a  man who turned out to be a vicious enemy  and  above all there wasnothing to be done theres no arguing with the mentally ill     and  why actually were you  brought  here  the doctor asked afterlistening attentively to homelesss denunciations     devil take them the numskulls they  seized me tied  me up with somerags and dragged me away in a truck     may i ask why you came to the restaurant in just your underwear     theres  nothing surprising about that ivan  replied i  went for  aswim in the moscow river so they filched my clothes and left me this trashi couldnt very  well walk around moscow  naked i  put it  on because i washurrying to griboedovs restaurant    
the doctor glanced questioningly at riukhin who muttered glumly     the name of the restaurant     aha  said  the  doctor  and  why were you  in  such a  hurry somebusiness meeting     im trying to catch the  consultant ivan nikolaevich said and lookedaround anxiously     what consultant     do you know berlioz ivan asked significantly     the    composer     ivan got upset     what composer ah yes  ah no the  composer  has the same name asmisha berlioz     riukhin had no wish to say anything but was forced to explain     the secretary of massolit berlioz was run over  by a tramcar tonightat the patriarchs ponds     dont blab about what you dont know ivan got angry with riukhin iwas there not you he got him under the tramcar on purpose     pushed him     pushed  him  nothing  ivan  exclaimed  angered  by  the  generalobtuseness  his kind dont need to push he can perform such stunts  holdon  to  your hat he knew  beforehand  that 
berlioz  would  get  under  thetramcar     and did anyone besides you see this consultant     thats the trouble it was just berlioz and i     so  and what measures did you take to  catch this murderer here thedoctor  turned and sent  a glance towards a  woman in a white coat who  wassitting  at  a table to one side she took out  a sheet of  paper  and beganfilling in the blank spaces in its columns     heres what measures i took a little candle from the kitchen     that one asked the doctor pointing to the broken candle lying on thetable in front of the woman next to the icon     that very one and        and why the icon     ah yes  the  icon       ivan  blushed it  was  the  icon  thatfrightened them  most of all  he again jabbed his finger  in the directionofriukhin but the thing  is that  he the  consultant  he  lets speakdirectly    is mixed up with the unclean powers    and you wont catchhim so easily     the orderlies for some reason snapped
to attention and  fastened  theireyes on ivan     yes sirs  ivan  went on  mixed up with them an absolute fact  hespoke personally with pontius pilate  and  theres no need  to stare  at melike that im telling the truth he saw everything   the balcony  and thepalm trees in short he was at pontius pilates i can vouch for it     come come       well so i pinned the icon on my chest and ran       here the clock suddenly struck twice     ohoh ivan exclaimed and  got up from the couch its  two oclockand im wasting time with you excuse me wheres the telephone     let him use the telephone the doctor told the orderlies     ivan  grabbed  the receiver  and  the  woman  meanwhile  quietly askedriukhin     is he married     single riukhin answered fearfully     member of a trade union     yes     police   ivan   shouted   into   the   receiver  police   comradeofficeronduty give orders at once for five motor cycles with machinegunsto be sent out
to catch the foreign  consultant what come and  pick me upill go with you   its the poet homeless speaking from the madhouse  whats  your address homeless asked the  doctor in a whisper covering thereceiver with his hand and then again shouting into it are you listeninghello      outrageous ivan  suddenly  screamed and hurled the receiveragainst the wall then he  turned to the  doctor offered him his hand saidgoodbye drily and made as if to leave     for  pitys sake where do you intend to go the doctor said peeringinto ivans  eyes in the dead of night  in your underwear   youre notfeeling well stay with us     let  me  pass  ivan said to the  orderlies who  closed ranks at thedoor will you let me pass or not the poet shouted in a terrible voice     riukhin  trembled but the woman  pushed  a button  on the table  and ashiny little box with a sealed ampoule popped out on to its glass surface     ah  so  ivan  said turning around  with a wild  and hunted 
lookwell then    goodbye and he rushed head first into the windowblind     the  crash was rather  forceful but the glass behind the blind gave nocrack and in an instant ivan nikolaevich was struggling in the hands of theorderlies he gasped tried to bite shouted     so thats the sort of windows youve got here let me go let me go       a syringe  flashed  in  the  doctors hand with  a single movement thewoman  slit the  threadbare sleeve  of  the  shirt and  seized the  arm withunwomanly strength there was a  smell of ether ivan went limp in the handsof the four people the deft doctor  took advantage of this moment and stuckthe needle into ivans arm they held ivan for  another few seconds and thenlowered him on to the couch     bandits ivan shouted and jumped up from the couch but was installedon it again the moment they let go of him he again jumped up but sat backdown  by himself he paused gazing around wildly then unexpectedly yawnedthen smiled maliciously     locked
me up after all he said yawned again unexpectedly lay downput his  head  on  the pillow  his fist under his  head  like a  child andmuttered now in a sleepy voice without  malice very well then  youllpay for it yourselves  ive warned  you you  can do as you like   imnow interested most of all in pontius pilate  pilate   and he closedhis eyes     a bath  a private  room number 117  and  a nurse to watch him thedoctor ordered as  he put his glasses on here  riukhin again gave a  startthe white  door  opened noiselessly behind it a corridor could be seen litby blue nightlights out  of  the corridor rolled  a  stretcher  on  rubberwheels to  which the  quieted ivan was transferred and  then he rolled offdown the corridor and the door closed behind him     doctor the shaken riukhin  asked in a whisper it means hes reallyill     oh yes replied the doctor     but whats wrong with him then riukhin asked timidly     the tired doctor glanced at riukhin and
answered listlessly     locomotor and speech excitation     delirious interpretations  acomplex case it seems  schizophrenia  i suppose plus this alcoholism       riukhin understood nothing from the  doctors words except that thingswere evidently not so great with ivan nikolaevich he sighed and asked     but whats all this talk of his about some consultant     he  must have seen  somebody who struck his disturbed imagination  ormaybe a hallucination      a  few minutes later the truck was carrying  riukhin off to moscow daywas breaking  and  the light  of the street lights still burning  along thehighway was  now unnecessary and unpleasant the driver was vexed at  havingwasted  the night drove the truck  as fast as  he could and skidded on theturns     now the woods dropped off stayed somewhere behind and  the river wentsomewhere to the side and an  omnium  gatherum came  spilling  to  meet thetruck fences with sentry boxes and stacks of wood tall posts and some sortof poles
with spools strung on the poles heaps of rubble the earth scoredby canals  in short  you sensed that she was there moscow right  therearound the turn and about to heave herself upon you and engulf you     riukhin  was jolted and tossed  about the sort of stump he had  placedhimself on kept trying  to slide out from under him the restaurant napkinsthrown in by the policeman and pantelei who  had left earlier by bus movedall  around the  flatbed riukhin tried to collect  them but then for somereason hissing spitefully devil take them what  am i doing fussing like afool  he spumed them aside with his foot and stopped looking at them     the riders state of mind was terrible it was  becoming clear that hisvisit to the house of sorrow had left the deepest mark on him riukhin triedto understand what was tormenting him the corridor with  blue lights whichhad  stuck  itself  to  his  memory  the  thought that there  is no greatermisfortune in the world than the loss of reason  yes yes
of course thattoo but that  thats only a general thought theres something  else whatis it an insult thats what yes yes insulting words hurled right in hisface by homeless and the trouble is not that  they were insulting but thatthere was truth in them     the  poet no longer looked around but staring into the dirty shakingfloor began muttering something whining gnawing at himself     yes poetry  he was thirtytwo years old and indeed what then sothen he  would go on writing  his  several poems a year into old  age yesinto old age what would these poems bring him glory what nonsense dontdeceive  yourself at least glory will never come to someone who writes badpoems what makes them  bad the  truth he was  telling the truth riukhinaddressed himself mercilessly i dont believe in anything i write        poisoned  bv this  burst of  neurasthenia  the poet swayed  the floorunder  him stopped shaking riukhin raised his head and saw that he had longbeen in  moscow
and  whats more that it was dawn  over moscow  that thecloud was underlit with gold that his truck had stopped caught in a columnof  other  vehicles at the turn on to the boulevard and  that very close tohim on a pedestal stood a  metal man his head  inclined slightly gazing atthe boulevard with indifference     some strange thoughts flooded the head of  the ailing poet theres anexample of real  luck    here riukhin rose  to  his full height  on  theflatbed  of  the truck  and  raised his arm  for some reason attacking  thecastiron man who was  not bothering anyone whatever step he  made in  hislife whatever happened to  him it all turned to his benefit it all led tohis glory  but what did  he  do i  cant conceive   is  there  anythingspecial in the words the snowstorm covers    i dont understand  luck sheer luck riukhin concluded with venom  and  felt the truck movingunder him  he  shot him that white  guard shot  him smashed his hip andassured his immortality    
the column began to move in no more  than  two minutes the completelyill  and even aged poet was entering the veranda of griboedovs  it was nowempty in a corner some company was finishing its drinks  and in the middlethe familiar master of  ceremonies  was bustling about wearing  a skullcapwith a glass of abrau wine in his hand     riukhin  laden   with   napkins   was   met   affably  by   archibaldarchibaldovich and at once relieved  of the cursed  rags  had riukhin  notbecome so  worn out in the  clinic and on the truck he would certainly havederived  pleasure from telling how everything had gone  in  the hospital andembellishing the story  with invented details but just then he was far fromsuch things  and little  observant  though  riukhin  was now  after  thetorture on the truck he peered keenly at the pirate for the first time  andrealized  that  though the  man  asked about  homeless  and  even exclaimedaiyaiyai he was essentially quite indifferent  to  homelesss fate anddid 
not  feel a bit sorry for him  and bravo  right  you  are  riukhinthought  with cynical selfannihilating malice and breaking off  the storyabout the schizophrenia begged     archibald  archibaldovich  a drop of  vodka    the pirate made  acompassionate face and whispered     i understand    this very minute    and beckoned to a waiter aquarter of an hour later riukhin sat in complete solitude hunched over hisbream drinking glass after glass understanding and recognizing that it wasno longer  possible to  set  anything right in  his life that  it was  onlypossible to forget     the  poet  had  wasted his night  while  others  were feasting and  nowunderstood  that it was impossible to get it  back one needed only to raiseones head  from  the  lamp  to  the  sky to understand  that  the night wasirretrievably lost waiters were hurriedly tearing the  tablecloths from thetables the  cats  slinking  around  the veranda  had  a morning  look  dayirresistibly heaved itself upon the
poet

chapter 7 a naughty apartment       if styopa likhodeev had  been told the next morning styopa youll beshot if  you dont get  up this minute   styopa would have replied in  alanguid barely audible voice shoot me do what  you like with me i wontget up     not only not get up it seemed to him  that he could not open his eyesbecause if he were to do so  there would be a  flash of  lightning and hishead  would  at once  be  blown to pieces a heavy bell was booming  in thathead brown  spots rimmed with fiery green floated between  his eyeballs andhis  closed eyelids and to crown it all he was nauseous this nausea as itseemed  to  him  being  connected  with  the  sounds  of  some  importunategramophone     styopa tried to recall something but only one thing would get recalled that yesterday  apparently and in some unknown place he had stood witha  napkin in his  hand and tried to  kiss some lady  promising her that thenext day and  exactly  at noon  he would come to  visit her  the lady haddeclined 
saying  no no i  wont be home but  styopa  had stubbornlyinsisted and ill just up and come anyway     who the lady  was and  what time it was now  what day of what monthstyopa decidedly did not know and worst  of  all  he could not figure outwhere  he was he attempted to learn this last  at  least  and to  that endunstuck  the stucktogether lids of his left eye something gleamed dully inthe semidarkness styopa  finally  recognized the  pierglass  and realizedthat he  was  lying on  his back in his  own  bed   that is the jewellerswifes  former bed    in the  bedroom here he felt such a throbbing in hishead that he closed his eyes and moaned     let us explain styopa likhodeev director of  the variety theatre hadcome to his  senses that morning at  home  in the very  apartment  which heshared with the late berlioz in  a big sixstoreyed ushaped building  onsadovaya street     it must be said that this apartment   no50   had long  had if not abad at least a strange
reputation two years ago  it had still belonged  tothe  widow  of  the jeweller de  fougeray anna  frantsevna  de fougeray  arespectable and  very practical fiftyyearold woman  let out three of  thefive  rooms  to  lodgers  one  whose last name was apparently belomut  andanother with a lost last name     and  then  two years ago inexplicable events  began  to  occur in  thisapartment people began to disappear from this apartment without a trace     once on  a  day off a  policeman  came to  the apartment  called thesecond lodger the one whose last name got lost out to the  front hall andsaid he was invited to come to the police station  for  a  minute to put hissignature to something the lodger told  anfisa anna frantsevnas longtimeand  devoted housekeeper to say in case  he received any  telephone callsthat he would be back  in  ten  minutes and left together with  the properwhitegloved policeman he not only did  not come  back in  ten minutes butnever came back at  all the most
surprising  thing  was that the  policemanevidently vanished along with him     the  pious or to speak  more  frankly superstitious anfisa  declaredoutright to  the very upset anna frantsevna that it was sorcery and that sheknew perfectly well  who had stolen both the lodger  and the policeman onlyshe did not wish to talk about it towards nighttime     well but with sorcery as  everyone knows  once it starts theres nostopping  it the  second lodger  is  remembered  to  have disappeared on  amonday and that wednesday belomut seemed to drop from sight though  trueunder different circumstances in the morning a car came  as usual to takehim  to  work and it did take him to work but it did not bring anyone backor come again itself     madame  belomuts  grief  and horror  defied  description  but  alasneither  the  one nor the other  continued for  long  that  same  night onreturning with anfisa from her dacha which anna frantsevna had  hurried offto for  some reason she did not find  the 
wife of citizen  belomut  in theapartment  and not only that the  doors of  the  two rooms occupied by thebelomut couple turned out to be sealed     two  days passed  somehow  on the third  day anna frantsevna who hadsuffered all the while from insomnia again left hurriedly for her dacha   needless to say she never came back     left alone  anfisa  having wept her  fill  went  to  sleep past  oneoclock  in  the morning what happened to her after that is not  known butlodgers in  other apartments told of hearing some sort of knocking all nightin  no50 and of seeing electric light burning  in the windows till morningin the morning it turned out that there was also no anfisa     for a long time all sorts of legends  were  repeated in the house aboutthese  disappearances  and  about  the  accursed  apartment  such  as  forinstance that this dry  and pious little  anfisa had supposedly carried onher  driedup breast in a suede bag twentyfive big diamonds  belonging toanna frantsevna that
in  the woodshed of  that  very dacha  to  which  annafrantsevna had gone so hurriedly there supposedly turned up of themselvessome inestimable treasures  in the form of those  same diamonds  plus  somegold coins of tsarist minting  and so on in the same vein well what wedont know we cant vouch for     however it may have been the apartment stood empty and sealed for onlya week then the late berlioz moved in  with his wife and this same styopaalso  with his wife it was perfectly natural that as soon as they got intothe  malignant  apartment devil  knows  what started happening with them aswell namely within the space of a month both wives vanished but these twonot without a trace of berliozs wife it  was told that  she had supposedlybeen seen in kharkov with some  balletmaster while styopas wife allegedlyturned up on bozhedomka  street where wagging  tongues said the director ofthe variety using his innumerable acquaintances had contrived to get her aroom but on the one condition
that  she never show her face on sadovaya       and so styopa moaned he wanted to call the housekeeper grunya and askher for aspirin but was still able to realize that it was foolish and thatgrunya  of course  had no aspirin  he  tried  to call  berlioz  for helpgroaned  twice misha     misha      but  as you  will understandreceived no reply the apartment was perfectly silent     moving his toes styopa realized that he was lying there in his  sockspassed  his trembling  hand  down  his  hip to determine whether he had  histrousers on or  not but failed  finally  seeing that he was abandoned andalone  and there  was no  one to  help  him he decided to get up  howeverinhuman the effort it cost him     styopa  unstuck his glued  eyelids  and  saw  himself  reflected in thepierglass as a man with hair sticking out in all directions with a bloatedphysiognomy covered with black  stubble  with puffy  eyes a  dirty  shirtcollar and necktie in drawers and socks     so he saw himself 
in the pierglass and next to  the mirror he saw anunknown man dressed in black and wearing a black beret     styopa sat up in bed and goggled his bloodshot eyes as well as he couldat the unknown man the  silence was broken by this unknown man who said ina low heavy voice and with a foreign accent the following words     good morning my most sympathetic stepan bogdanovich     there was  a pause  after which making  a  most  terrible  strain  onhimself styopa uttered     what can i do for  you   and was  amazed not  recognizing his  ownvoice he  spoke the word what in a treble can i in a bass and his dofor you did not come off at all     the stranger  smiled amicably took out a big gold watch with a diamondtriangle on the lid rang eleven times and said     eleven and for exactly an  hour ive been waiting for you to wake upsince you  made an appointment for me to come  to your  place at ten here iam     styopa  felt for his  trousers  on the chair beside his bed
whisperedexcuse me     put them on  and asked  hoarsely tell me  your  nameplease     he had difficulty speaking at  each word  someone stuck a needle intohis brain causing infernal pain     what youve forgotten my name too here the unknown man smiled     forgive  me    styopa  croaked  feeling  that  his  hangover  hadpresented him with a new symptom it seemed to him that the floor beside hisbed went away and that at any moment he would go flying down to the devilsdam in the nether world     my  dear stepan  bogdanovich the visitor said  with a perspicacioussmile no aspirin will  help you follow the wise old rule  cure like withlike the only thing  that  will  bring  you back to life is two glasses  ofvodka with something pickled and hot to go with it     styopa was a shrewd man and sick as he was realized that since he hadbeen found in this state he would have to confess everything     frankly  speaking  he began his  tongue barely moving yesterday igot a
bit     not a word more the visitor answered and drew aside with his chair     styopa  rolling his  eyes saw that  a  tray had been set on  a  smalltable on which  tray  there were  sliced white bread pressed  caviar  in alittle bowl pickled mushrooms on a dish  something  in  a  saucepan  andfinally vodka in  a roomy decanter belonging to  the  jewellers wife whatstruck  styopa especially was that the decanter  was frosty with cold thishowever was  understandable it was sitting in  a bowl packed with ice  inshort the service was neat efficient     the  stranger did not allow  styopas amazement to develop  to a morbiddegree but deftly poured him half a glass of vodka     and you styopa squeaked     with pleasure     his  hand twitching  styopa brought  the  glass to his lips while thestranger swallowed the contents of his glass at one gulp chewing a lump  ofcaviar styopa squeezed out of himself the words     and you  a bite of something     much  obliged but  i
never snack the  stranger replied  and  pouredseconds the saucepan was opened and found to contain frankfurters in tomatosauce     and then the accursed green haze before his eyes dissolved  the  wordsbegan to come out clearly and above all styopa remembered a thing or twonamely that it  had taken place yesterday in skhodnya at the dacha of  thesketchwriter  khustov  to which this same khustov  had  taken  styopa in ataxi there was even a memory of having hired this taxi by the metropol andthere  was also  some  actor or not an actor     with a gramophone in  alittle  suitcase  yes  yes  yes it  was  at  the  dacha  the  dogs  heremembered had howled from this gramophone only the lady styopa had wantedto kiss remained unexplained  devil  knows who she was   maybe she wasin radio maybe not       the previous day  was thus coming gradually into focus  but  right nowstyopa  was much more  interested in todays  day and  particularly in theappearance  in his bedroom of a stranger
and  with hors doeuvres and vodkato boot it would be nice to explain that     well i hope by now youve remembered my name     but styopa only smiled bashfully and spread his arms     really i get the feeling that you followed the vodka with port  winegood heavens it simply isnt done     i beg you to keep it between us styopa said fawningly     oh of course of course but as for khustov needless to say i cantvouch for him     so you know khustov     yesterday in your office i  saw this individuum briefly but it onlytakes a fleeting  glance at his face to  understand that he is a  bastard asquabbler a trimmer and a toady     perfectly  true thought  styopa struck by such a true  precise andsuccinct definition of khustov     yes  the previous  day was  piecing itself  together  but  even  soanxiety  would not take leave of the director  of the variety the thing wasthat  a  huge black  hole  yawned in  this  previous day say what you willstyopa  simply  had 
not seen  this  stranger  in  the  beret in  his officeyesterday     professor of  black  magic  woland  the  visitor  saidweightily seeing styopas difficulty and he recounted everything in order     yesterday afternoon he arrived in moscow from abroad  went immediatelyto styopa and offered his show to the variety styopa telephoned the moscowregional  entertainment  commission  and  had the question  approved styopaturned pale and  blinked then signed a contract  with professor woland forseven  performances  styopa  opened  his  mouth  and arranged that wolandshould come the next  morning at ten  oclock to work out the  details   and  so woland  came having come he was met by the housekeeper grunya whoexplained that she had just come herself  that she was  not a livein maidthat  berlioz was not home and  that if  the visitor wished to  see  stepanbogdanovich he  should  go to  his bedroom  himself stepan bogdanovich wassuch a  sound sleeper that she  would not undertake to wake
him  up  seeingwhat condition stepan  bogdanovich  was in the  artiste sent grunya  to thenearest grocery store for  vodka and hors  doeuvres  to the druggists forice and        allow  me  to  reimburse you the mortified styopa squealed and beganhunting for his wallet     oh  what  nonsense the  guest performer exclaimed and would hear nomore of it     and so the  vodka and hors  doeuvres got explained  but all the samestyopa was a pity to see he remembered decidedly nothing about the contractand on his life had not  seen this woland yesterday yes khustov had beenthere but not woland     may i have a look at the contract styopa asked quietly     please do please do      styopa looked at the paper and froze everything was in place first ofall styopas own dashing signature  aslant the margin a note in the handof  the  findirector  rimsky  authorizing  the payment of  tenthousand  roubles  to  the artiste woland  as an advance on the thirtyfivethousand  roubles due 
him for  seven  performances whats  more  wolandssignature was right there attesting to his receipt of the ten thousand     what  is all  this the wretched styopa thought his head  spinningwas  he starting to  have  ominous gaps  of memory well  it  went  withoutsaying once the  contract had  been  produced any  further expressions  ofsurprise would  simply  be indecent  styopa  asked  his visitors  leave toabsent  himself for a moment  and just as he was in his stocking feet ranto the  front hall  for  the  telephone on his  way he  called out  in  thedirection of the kitchen     grunya     but no one responded he  glanced at the door to berliozs study whichwas next to the front hall and here he was  as they say flabbergasted onthe doorhandle he made out an enormous wax seal on a string     hello  someone barked in styopas head just what we  needed andhere styopas thoughts began  running on twin tracks but as always happensin times of catastrophe in  the same direction
and generally  devil knowswhere it  is even difficult to  convey the  porridge in styopas head herewas this devilry with the black beret the chilled vodka and the incrediblecontract    and along with all that if you please a seal on the door aswell that is tell anyone you like that  berlioz has been up  to no good no one will believe it by  jove no one will believe  it yet look theresthe seal yes sir     and here  some most  disagreeable  little thoughts  began  stirring  instyopas brain about  the  article  which as  luck would  have it  he hadrecently inflicted on mikhail alexandrovich for  publication in his journalthe article just between us was idiotic and worthless and  the money wasso little        immediately after the recollection of the  article there came flying arecollection of some dubious conversation that had taken place he recalledon the twentyfourth  of  april in the evening  right there in  the diningroom while styopa was having dinner with mikhail
alexandrovich that is ofcourse this conversation  could not have been  called dubious in  the  fullsense of the word styopa would not have ventured upon such a conversationbut it  was  on  some unnecessary  subject  he  had been quite  free  dearcitizens  not  to  begin  it  before  the  seal  this  conversation wouldundoubtedly have been considered  a perfect trifle but now after the seal     ah berlioz berlioz boiled up in styopas head this is simply  toomuch for one head     but it  would not do to grieve too  long and styopa dialled the numberof the office  of the  varietys  findirector rimsky styopas position wasticklish first the foreigner might get offended  that  styopa was checkingon  him  after  the  contract  had  been shown and  then  to  talk with thefindirector was also exceedingly difficult indeed he could  not  just  askhim  like that tell  me did i  sign a  contract for  thirtyfive thousandroubles yesterday  with a professor of  black magic it was  no good
askinglike that     yes rimskys sharp unpleasant voice came from the receiver     hello  grigory  danilovich  styopa  began  speaking  quiedy  itslikhodeev theres a certain matter  hm  hm  i have this   er  artiste woland sitting here   so you see  i wanted to ask how aboutthis evening        ah the black magician rimskys voice responded in the receiver theposters will be ready shortly     uhhuh    styopa said in a weak voice well bye       and youll be coming in soon rimsky asked     in half an hour styopa replied and hanging up the receiver pressedhis hot  head in his hands ah what a nasty thing to have happen what  waswrong with his memory citizens eh     however to go on  lingering in the front hall  was awkward and styopaformed  a  plan  straight  away by  all  means  to  conceal  his incredibleforgetfulness and now first off contrive  to  get  out  of the  foreignerwhat in fact he intended  to  show that  evening  in
the variety of whichstyopa was in charge     here  styopa turned away from  the telephone  and saw  distincdy in themirror that stood in the front hall and which the lazy grunya had not wipedfor ages a  certain strange specimen  long as a pole and in  a  pincenezah if only  ivan nikolaevich had been there he would have recognized thisspecimen at once the  figure was reflected and  then disappeared  styopalooked further  down the hall in alarm and was  rocked a second time for inthe mirror a stalwart black cat passed and also disappeared     styopas heart skipped a beat he staggered     what is all  this he  thought am i losing my mind where are thesereflections  coming  from  he  peeked  into  the  front  hall  and  criedtimorously     grunya whats this cat doing  hanging around here where did he comefrom and the other one     dont worry stepan bogdanovich a voice  responded not grunyas butthe visitors from the  bedroom the  cat is  mine  dont be nervous  andgrunya
is not here i sent her off  to  voronezh she complained you diddledher out of a vacation     these words were  so unexpected and preposterous that styopa decided hehad not heard right utterly bewildered he trotted back to the  bedroom andfroze on the threshold his hair stood on end and small beads of sweat brokeout on his brow     the visitor was no longer alone in the bedroom but had company in thesecond armchair sat the same type he  had imagined in the front hall now hewas  clearly visible the  feathery  moustache  one  lens of  the pincenezgleaming the other not  there but  worse  things  were to  be found in thebedroom  on the jewellers wifes ottoman  in  a  casual pose sprawled  athird party  namely a black cat of uncanny size with a glass of vodka inone  paw and a fork on which he had managed to spear a pickled mushroom inthe other     the light faint in the bedroom anyway now began to grow quite dark instyopas  eyes this is apparently how one loses ones mind  he  thoughtand
caught hold of the doorpost     i  see  youre  somewhat  surprised  my dearest  stepan bogdanovichwoland inquired of the teethchattering styopa and  yet theres nothing tobe surprised at this is my retinue     here the cat tossed  off the vodka and styopas hand  began  to  slidedown the doorpost     and this  retinue  requires room woland continued  so theres justone too many of us in the apartment and  it seems  to us  that this one toomany is precisely you     theirself theirself the long  checkered one sang in  a goats voicereferring to styopa in the plural generally theirself has been up to someterrible swinishness lately drinking using their position to have liaisonswith  women dont do devil a  thing and  cant  do  anything because theydont know  anything of what theyre supposed to  do pulling  the wool overtheir superiors eyes     availing  hisself  of a  government car the cat  snitched chewing amushroom     and here occurred the  fourth and last appearance 
in the apartment asstyopa having slid all the way to the floor clawed at the doorpost with anenfeebled hand     straight  from  the  pierglass  stepped  a  short but  extraordinarilybroadshouldered man with a bowler hat on his head and a fang sticking  outof  his  mouth  which  made  still  uglier  a  physiognomy  unprecedentedlyloathsome without that and with flaming red hair besides     generally this  new  one  entered  into  the conversation i  dontunderstand how  he got  to  be a director  the redheads nasal  twang  wasgrowing stronger and stronger hes as much a director as im a bishop     you  dont  look  like  a  bishop  azazello  the  catobserved heaping his plate with frankfurters     thats what i mean  twanged  the  redhead and turning to woland  headded deferentially  allow me messire to  chuck  him  the  devil  out ofmoscow     scat the cat barked suddenly bristling his fur     and  then  the bedroom started spinning  around styopa he hit his
headagainst the doorpost and losing consciousness thought im dying     but he did  not die opening his eyes slightly he saw  himself sittingon something made  of  stone around him something was making noise when heopened his eyes properly  he realized that the noise  was being made by thesea and whats more that  the waves were rocking just at his feet that hewas in short  sitting  at the very  end of  a  jetty that over him was  abrilliant blue sky and behind him a white city on the mountains     not  knowing how  to  behave in  such  a  case  styopa  got up  on histrembling legs and walked along the jetty towards the shore     some man was standing on the  jetty smoking and spitting into the seahe looked at styopa with wild eyes and stopped spitting     then  styopa  pulled  the  following stunt  he  knelt down before  theunknown smoker and said     i implore you tell me what city is this     really said the heartless smoker     im not drunk  styopa replied hoarsely
somethings happened to  me im ill  where am i what city is this     well its yalta       styopa  quietly gasped and sank down on his side his head striking thewarm stone of the jetty consciousness left him

chapter 8 the combat between the professor and the poet       at  the  same  time  that consciousness left styopa in  yalta that isaround half past  eleven in  the morning  it  returned to ivan  nikolaevichhomeless  who woke  up  after a long  and  deep  sleep  he spent some timepondering how it was that he had wound  up in an  unfamiliar room with whitewalls with an astonishing  night table made of  some light metal  and withwhite blinds behind which one could sense the sun     ivan  shook his head ascertained that it  did not ache and rememberedthat  he  was  in  a clinic this thought drew  after it  the remembrance ofberliozs death but today it did not provoke a strong shock in ivan havinghad a good sleep ivan  nikolaevich became calmer  and  began to  think moreclearly after  lying motionless for  some time in this most clean soft andcomfortable spring bed ivan noticed a bell button beside him  from a habitof touching things needlessly ivan pressed it  he expected the pressing ofthe  button  to be followed  by some  ringing  or appearance 
but somethingentirely different  happened a frosted glass cylinder with the word drinkon it lit  up  at  the foot of ivans bed after  pausing for a  while  thecylinder began to rotate until the word nurse  popped out it goes withoutsaying that the clever  cylinder amazed ivan  the word nurse was replacedby the words call the doctor     hm      said  ivan not knowing how to proceed  further with  thiscylinder but here he happened to be lucky ivan pressed the button a secondtime  at  the  word  attendant  the cylinder  rang  quietly in  responsestopped the light went out and a plump sympathetic woman in a clean whitecoat came into the room and said to ivan     good morning     ivan did not reply considering such a greeting inappropriate under thecircumstances  indeed  they lock up a healthy man in a clinic and pretendthat that is how it ought to be     the  woman  meanwhile  without  losing  her  goodnatured  expressionbrought the blinds up with  one push of a button  and
sun flooded the  roomthrough  a  light and  widemeshed grille which reached right  to the floorbeyond  the grille  a  balcony came  into  view  beyond that the  bank of ameandering river and on its other bank a cheerful pine wood     time for our bath the woman invited and  under her hands the  innerwall parted revealing behind it a bathroom and splendidly equipped toilet     ivan  though he had resolved not to talk to the woman could  not helphimself and on seeing the water gush into the tub in a wide stream from thegleaming faucet said ironically     looky there just like the metropol        oh no the woman answered proudly much  better there  is no  suchequipment even anywhere abroad  scientists  and doctors  come especially tostudy our clinic we have foreign tourists every day     at  the words foreign tourists ivan at  once remembered  yesterdaysconsultant ivan darkened looked sullen and said     foreign  tourists   how  you all adore foreign tourists but  amongthem 
incidentally you come  across  all sorts i for  instance met  oneyesterday  quite something     and  he almost  started telling about  pontius  pilate but  restrainedhimself realizing that the woman had no use for  these stories that in anycase she could not help him     the  washed  ivan  nikolaevich  was  straight  away  issued   decidedlyeverything a man needs  after a  bath  an ironed shirt drawers socks andnot only that opening the door of a cupboard  the woman pointed inside andasked     what would you like to put ona dressing gown or some nice pyjamas     attached to his new dwelling by force ivan almost clasped his hands atthe womans casualness and silendy pointed his finger at the crimson flannelpyjamas     after this  ivan  nikolaevich was led  down  the  empty and  noiselesscorridor and brought to an  examining room of huge  dimensions ivan havingdecided  to take  an  ironic attitude towards everything to be found in thiswondrously  equipped building at once  mentally 
christened  this  room theindustrial kitchen     and with good reason here stood cabinets and glass cases with gleamingnickelplated  instruments  there  were  chairs of extraordinarily  complexconstruction some potbellied  lamps with shiny shades a myriad of phialsbunsen burners electric cords and appliances quite unknown to anyone     in the examining room ivan was taken over by three persons  two  womenand  a man   all  in white  first they  led ivan to a corner to a littletable with the obvious purpose of getting something or other out of him     ivan began to ponder the  situation three  ways stood before him  thefirst  was extremely  tempting to  hurl  himself  at all  these  lamps  andsophisticated little things make the devils own wreck of them and therebyexpress his protest at being detained  for nothing but todays ivan alreadydiffered  significantly  from  the ivan  of yesterday  and this  first  wayappeared dubious to  him for all he knew the thought might get  rooted  inthem
that he was a violent madman therefore  ivan rejected  the first  waythere was a second immediately to begin his  account of the  consultant andpontius  pilate  however  yesterdays experience  showed  that  this storyeither  was  not believed  or was taken somehow perversely  therefore  ivanrenounced this second  way as  well  deciding  to  choose the  third  way withdrawal into proud silence     he  did  not  succeed  in realizing it  fully and  had  willynilly toanswer though charily and  glumly a whole series of  questions thus  theygot out of ivan decidedly everything about his  past life down to  when andhow he  had  fallen  ill with scarlet fever fifteen  years ago a whole pagehaving  been covered  with writing about  ivan  it was turned over and thewoman  in  white went on to questions about ivans relatives  some  sort ofhumdrum started who died when and why and whether he drank or had venerealdisease  and more  of the  same in conclusion  he  was asked to tell aboutyesterdays events
at the patriarchs ponds but they did not pester him toomuch and were not surprised at the information about pontius pilate     here the  woman yielded  ivan up to the  man  who went  to work on himdifferently and no longer asked  any questions  he  took the temperature ofivans body counted his pulse looked  in ivans eyes  directing some sortof lamp into them then the  second woman  came to the mans assistance andthey pricked ivan in  the back with something but  not painfully drew somesigns on the skin of his  chest  with  the handle of a little hammer tappedhis knees with the hammer which  made ivans  legs jump pricked his fingerand took  his  blood  pricked him inside  his bent elbow put  some  rubberbracelets on his arms      ivan just smiled  bitterly to himself and reflected on how stupidly andstrangely it had all happened just think he had wanted to warn them all ofthe danger threatening from the unknown  consultant  had intended  to catchhim and all he had achieved was to wind
up in some mysterious room tellingall sorts of hogwash about uncle fyodor who had done some hard  drinking invologda insufferably stupid     finally ivan was released he was escorted back  to  his room where hewas given a cup of coffee two softboiled eggs and white bread with butterhaving  eaten  and drunk all that was offered him ivan decided to  wait forwhoever was chief of this  institution  and  from this chief to obtain bothattention for himself and justice     and he did come  and very soon  after ivans  breakfast unexpectedlythe door of ivans room opened  and in came a lot of people in white coatsat their head walked a  man of about fortyfive  as carefully shaven  as anactor  with  pleasant but quite  piercing eyes and  courteous  manners thewhole  retinue  showed him tokens of attention and respect and his entrancetherefore came out very solemn like pontius pilate thought ivan     yes this  was unquestionably the chief  he sat down on a stool whileeveryone else remained standing    
doctor stravinsky the seated man introduced himself to ivan and gavehim a friendly look     here alexander nikolaevich someone with a trim beard  said in a lowvoice and handed the chief ivans chart all covered with writing     theyve  sewn up a whole case ivan thought and the chief ran throughthe chart with a practised eye muttered mmhm  mmhm   and exchangeda few phrases  with those  around  him in a  littleknown  language and hespeaks  latin like pilate ivan thought sadly here one word made him jumpit  was  the  word schizophrenia  alas  already uttered yesterday by thecursed  foreigner  at  the  patriarchs  ponds  and  now repeated today  byprofessor stravinsky and he knew that too ivan thought anxiously     the  chief apparently  made it  a  rule to agree  with and rejoice overeverything said to him by those  around  him and to express  this with  thewords very nice very nice      very nice said stravinsky handing the chart back to someone and headdressed
ivan     you are a poet     a  poet ivan  replied glumly and for  the  first time suddenly feltsome inexplicable loathing for poetry and his own verses coming to mind atonce seemed to him for some reason distasteful     wrinkling his face he asked stravinsky in turn     you are a professor     to this stravinsky with obliging courtesy inclined his head     and youre the chief here ivan continued     stravinsky nodded to this as well     i must speak with you ivan nikolaevich said meaningly     that is what im here for returned stravinsky     the thing is ivan began feeling his hour had come that  ive beengot up as a madman and nobody wants to listen to me     oh no we  shall hear you out  with great attention stravinsky saidseriously and  soothingly and by  no means allow  you  to  be  got up as amadman     listen  then  yesterday  evening  i met a  mysterious person at  thepatriarchs ponds  maybe a  foreigner maybe not who knew beforehand aboutberliozs
death and has seen pontius pilate in person     the retinue listened to the poet silently and without stirring     pilate the pilate who lived in the time  of jesus christ stravinskyasked narrowing his eyes at ivan     the same     aha said stravinsky and this berlioz died under a tramcar     precisely hes the  one who in my presence  was killed by a  tramcaryesterday at the ponds and this same mysterious citizen       the  acquaintance  of  pontius  pilate  asked  stravinsky apparentlydistinguished by great mental alacrity     precisely him ivan confirmed studying stravinsky well so he saidbeforehand that annushka had  spilled the sunflower  oil  and  he slippedright  on  that  place how do you like that  ivan inquired significantlyhoping to produce a great effect with his words     but  the  effect  did not ensue  and stravinsky quite simply asked thefollowing question     and who is this annushka     this question upset ivan a little his face twitched    
annushka  is of absolutely  no  importance  here  he said nervouslydevil knows who she  is just some  fool from sadovaya whats important isthat he knew  beforehand you  see beforehand about the sunflower  oil doyou understand me     perfectly  stravinsky  replied  seriously  and  touching the poetsknee added dont get excited just continue     to continue said ivan trying to  fall in with stravinskys tone andknowing already  from bitter experience that only  calm would help him sothen  this horrible  type and hes lying that hes a  consultant has someextraordinary  power      for instance  you chase  after him  and  itsimpossible to catch up with him    and  theres also  a little pair  withhim  good ones too  but in their own way some long one in broken glassesand besides  him a  cat  of incredible size  who  rides  the  tram  all byhimself and besides interrupted by no one ivan went on talking with everincreasing  ardour and  conviction he  was personally 
on pontius pilatesbalcony theres  no doubt  of  it  so  what is all this eh  he  must  bearrested immediately otherwise hell do untold harm     so  youre  trying  to  get   him  arrested  have  i  understood  youcorrectly asked stravinsky     hes intelligent thought ivan youve  got  to  admit  even  amongintellectuals you come across some of  rare intelligence theres no denyingit and he replied     quite  correctly and  how  could  i not be trying  just consider foryourself and  meanwhile ive been  forcibly  detained here they poke lampsinto my eyes  give  me baths  question me for some reason  about my  unclefedya    and  he departed this world  long ago i demand  to be releasedimmediately     well  there  very  nice  very  nice  stravinsky  responded  noweverythings  clear really whats the sense of  keeping a healthy man in aclinic very well sir ill check you out of here right now if you tell meyoure normal not prove but merely tell so then
are you normal     here complete  silence fell and  the  fat woman who had taken  care ofivan in  the  morning looked at the  professor  with awe ivan  thought onceagain positively intelligent     the  professors offer pleased  him very  much yet  before replying hethought very very hard wrinkling his forehead and at last said firmly     i am normal     well how very nice  stravinsky exclaimed with relief and  if  solets  reason logically lets  take your day yesterday here he turned andivans chart was immediately handed to him in search of an unknown man whorecommended himself as an acquaintance of pontius pilate  you performed thefollowing  actions yesterday  here stravinsky began holding  up  his  longfingers glancing now at the chart now at ivan you hung a  little icon onyour chest did you     i did ivan agreed sullenly     you fell off  a  fence  and  hurt  your face right showed  up  in  arestaurant  carrying  a  burning candle in  your  hand in  nothing but

the  little  beard ordered fyodor vassilyevich pleasecheck citizen homeless out for town but dont  put anyone  in  his  room orchange the  linen in two  hours  citizen homeless will  be back here  sothen he  turned  to the poet i wont wish you success  because  i dontbelieve  one iota  in  that  success see you soon  he stood up  and  hisretinue stirred     on what grounds will i be back here ivan asked anxiously     stravinsky was as if waiting  for this  question immediately sat downand began to speak     on  the grounds that as soon  as you  show up at the police station inyour  drawers and  tell them youve seen  a  man  who  knew  pontius  pilatepersonally youll instandy be brought here and youll find yourself  againin this very same room     what have  drawers  got to do with it ivan asked  gazing around  inbewilderment     its mainly pontius pilate but  the drawers too because  well takethe clinic underwear  from you and give you back your  clothes and you

the heirs were announced     the news of berliozs  death spread through the whole house with a sortof supernatural speed and as of seven oclock thursday morning bosoy beganto  receive telephone  calls  and  then personal  visits  with  declarationscontaining claims  to the  deceaseds living  space  in the period  of  twohours nikanor ivanovich received thirtytwo such declarations     they  contained pleas threats  libels denunciations  promises to dorenovations at their  own expense references to unbearable overcrowding andthe impossibility of living in the same apartment with bandits among othersthere were  a  description staggering  in  its artistic power of the theftfrom  apartment  no  51 of some meat dumplings  tucked  directly into  thepocket of a suit jacket  two vows to end life by suicide and one confessionof secret pregnancy     nikanor ivanovich was  called out  to the front hall of  his apartmentplucked  by the sleeve whispered to  winked at promised that he would notbe left
the loser     this torture went on until noon when nikanor ivanovich simply fled hisapartment for the management office  by the gate but when he saw them lyingin wait for him  there  too he  fled that  place  as well having  somehowshaken  off  those  who followed  on  his  heels  across  the  asphaltpavedcourtyard nikanor ivanovich disappeared into the sixth entrance and went upto the fifth floor where this vile apartment no50 was located     after  catching  his  breath on  the  landing  the  corpulent  nikanorivanovich rang but no one opened  for  him  he rang again and then againand started  grumbling  and swearing quietly even then no  one  opened hispatience  exhausted  nikanor  ivanovich  took from his  pocket a  bunch  ofduplicate keys belonging to the  house management  opened the  door  with asovereign hand and went in     hey  housekeeper nikanor  ivanovich  cried in  the  semidark fronthall grunya or whatever your name is  are you here     no one responded     then
nikanor ivanovich took a folding ruler from his briefcase removedthe seal from the  door  to the study and stepped in stepped  in yes buthalted in amazement in the doorway and even gave a start     at the deceaseds desk sat an unknown skinny long citizen in a littlecheckered jacket a jockeys cap and a pincenez    well in short thatsame one     and who might you be citizen nikanor ivanovich asked fearfully     hah nikanor ivanovich the unexpected citizen yelled in  a  rattlingtenor  and  jumping  up  greeted  the  chairman  with a forced  and suddenhandshake this greeting by no means gladdened nikanor ivanovich     excuse me he said suspiciously  but who might you be are  you  anofficial person     eh nikanor ivanovich the unknown man exclaimed soulfully what areofficial and unofficial persons it all depends on your point of view on thesubject its all fluctuating and relative nikanor ivanovich  today im anunofficial  person and tomorrow lo and behold im
an official one and italso happens the other way round  oh how it does     this argument in no way satisfied the chairman of the house managementbeing a generally suspicious person by  nature he  concluded  that the  manholding forth in  front  of  him was  precisely  an  unofficial person  andperhaps even an idle one     fes  but who might you be  whats  your name the chairman inquiredwith increasing severity and even began to advance upon the unknown man     my  name  the citizen responded not  a bit put out by the severitywell  lets say its  koroviev  but wouldnt you  like  a  little  snacknikanor ivanovich no formalities eh     excuse  me  nikanor  ivanovich began indignantly  now  svhat  havesnacks  got to  do  with it we must  confess unpleasant as  it  is thatnikanor ivanovich was of a somewhat rude nature sitting in the deceasedshalf is not permitted what are you doing here     have  a seat nikanor ivanovich the citizen  went on yelling  not abit
at a loss and began fussing about offering the chairman a seat     utterly infuriated nikanor ivanovich rejected the seat and screamed     but who are you     i if you please  serve as interpreter for a  foreign individual  whohas taken up residence  in this apartment the man calling himself korovievintroduced himself and clicked the heels of his scuffed unpolished shoes     nikanor ivanovich opened his mouth the presence of  some  foreigner inthis apartment with an interpreter to boot came  as a complete surprise tohim and he demanded explanations     the interpreter explained willingly a foreign artiste mr woland  hadbeen kindly  invited  by the  director  of  the  variety stepan bogdanovichlikhodeev to  spend  the  time of his  performances a week  or so in  hisapartment about  which  he  had  written  to  nikanor ivanovich  yesterdayrequesting  that  he register  the foreigner  as a temporary resident whileukhodeev himself took a trip to yalta     he never wrote me anything
the chairman said in amazement     just  look   through  your  briefcase  nikanor  ivanovich  korovievsuggested sweetly     nikanor  ivanovich shrugging his shoulders  opened the  briefcase andfound likhodeevs letter in it     how  could i have forgotten about  it  nikanor  ivanovich  mutteredlooking dully at the opened envelope     all  sorts of things  happen nikanor ivanovich all  sorts korovievrattled  absentmindedness  absentmindedness  fatigue  and  high  bloodpressure  my  dear  friend nikanor  ivanovich im  terribly  absentmindedmyself someday over a glass ill tell you a few facts from my biography youll die laughing     and when is likhodeev going to yalta     hes  already  gone  gone  the  interpreter  cried  hes  alreadywheeling along  you know  hes already  devil  knows where  and here theinterpreter waved his arms like the wings of a windmill     nikanor ivanovich declared  that he must see  the foreigner in  personbut got a refusal on that from
the interpreter quite impossible hes busytraining the cat     the cat i can show you if you like koroviev offered     this  nikanor  ivanovich  refused  in  his turn  and  the  interpreterstraight  away  made  the  chairman  an  unexpected  but  quite  interestingproposal seeing that mr woland had no desire whatsoever to live in a hoteland was accustomed to having  a lot of  space  why shouldnt  the  tenantsassociation  rent to  him woland  for one  little week  the  time of  hisperformances in moscow  the whole of the apartment that is the deceasedsrooms as well     its all the same  to  him  the deceased   you must  agree  nikanorivanovich koroviev whispered hoarsely he doesnt need the apartment nowdoes he     nikanor ivanovich somewhat perplexed objected that  foreigners  oughtto live at the metropol and not in private apartments at all     im  telling  you  hes  capricious as  devil  knows  what korovievwhispered  he just doesnt want to he doesnt like hotels

out for it   no  one  knew butwith the foreign tourists money it might be possible to wriggle out of ithowever the practical  and prudent  nikanor ivanovich said  he  would firsthave to settle the question with the foreign tourist bureau     i  understand  koroviev   cried   out  youve  got  to  setde  itabsolutely heres the telephone nikanor  ivanovich settle it at once anddont be shy about the money  he added in a whisper drawing  the chairmanto the telephone in the front hall if he wont  pay who will you  shouldsee  the villa  hes  got  in nice  next  summer when you  go abroad comeespecially to see it  youll gasp     the business with  the  foreign  tourist bureau  was  arranged over thephone with an extraordinary speed quite amazing  to the chairman it turnedout  that they  already  knew about  mr  wolands  intention  of staying  inlikhodeevs private apartment and had no objections to it     thats  wonderful koroviev yelled somewhat stunned by  his chatterthe 
chairman  announced  that  the  tenants  association  agreed  to  rentapartment no50 for a week to the artiste woland for   nikanor ivanovichfaltered a little then said     for five hundred roubles a day     here  koroviev  utterly  amazed the chairman winking thievishly in thedirection of the bedroom from which the soft leaps of a heavy cat could  beheard he rasped out     so it comes to three thousand five hundred for the week     to which nikanor ivanovich thought he was going to  add some appetiteyouve got nikanor ivanovich but koroviev said something quite different     what kind of money is that ask five hell pay it     grinning perplexedly nikanor ivanovich  without noticing  how  foundhimself  at the deceaseds writing desk where koroviev with great speed anddexterity drew up a contract in two copies then he flew to the bedroom withthem  and  came  back  both  copies now  bearing  the  foreigners sweepingsignature the chairman also signed the contract here koroviev
asked  for areceipt for five       write it out write it out nikanor ivanovich  thousand roubles    and with words somehow unsuited to serious business bin zwei drei he laid out for the chairman five stacks of new banknotes     the countingup  took  place interspersed  with  korovievs quips  andquiddities  such as cash loves counting your own  eye wont  lie  andothers of the same sort     after  counting  the  money  the chairman  received  from koroviev theforeigners  passport for temporary registration put it together with  thecontract and  the money  into his briefcase and  somehow unable  to  helphimself sheepishly asked for a free pass      dont mention it bellowed koroviev  how many  tickets do you wantnikanor ivanovich  twelve fifteen     the flabbergasted chairman explained that all he needed was a couple ofpasses for himself and pelageya antonovna his wife     koroviev  snatched out a notebook at  once  and  dashed  off a pass fornikanor ivanovich
for two persons in the front row and with his  left handthe  interpreter deftly slipped  this pass to nikanor  ivanovich while withhis  right he  put into the chairmans other hand  a  thick  crackling wadcasting  an eye on it nikanor ivanovich blushed deeply and began to push itaway     it isnt done    he murmured     i wont  hear of it koroviev whispered right  in his  ear  with usits  not  done  but  with foreigners it is  youll  offend  him  nikanorivanovich and thats embarrassing youve worked hard       its  severely punishable the chairman  whispered very very  softlyand glanced over his shoulder     but where are the witnesses  koroviev whispered into  his other eari ask you where are they you dont think        here  as the chairman insisted afterwards a miracle occurred the wadcrept into his briefcase by  itself and then the chairman somehow limp andeven  broken found himself on the stairs a whirlwind  of thoughts raged inhis head there was the
villa in nice  and the trained cat and the thoughtthat there were  in  fact no witnesses and that pelageya antonovna would bedelighted  with  the  pass they  were incoherent  thoughts  but  generallypleasant but all the same somewhere some little needle kept pricking thechairman in the very bottom of  his  soul  this was  the needle of anxietybesides right then on the stairs the chairman was seized as with a strokeby the thought but how did the interpreter  get into the study if the doorwas sealed and how was it that he nikanor  ivanovich had not asked aboutit for some time  the chairman stood staring like a  sheep at the steps ofthe stairway but then he decided to spit on it and not torment himself withintricate questions        as soon as the chairman  left the  apartment a low voice came from thebedroom     i didnt like this nikanor ivanovich he  is  a chiseller and a crookcan it be arranged so that he doesnt come any more     messire you have only  to say the word  
koroviev responded  fromsomewhere not in a rattling but in a very clear and resounding voice     and  at once  the accursed  interpreter turned  up in the  front  halldialled a  number there and  for some reason began speaking  very tearfullyinto the receiver     hello i consider it my duty  to  inform you that the chairman  of ourtenants association at no502bis on sadovaya nikanor ivanovich bosoy  isspeculating in foreign currency at the present moment in hisapartment no 55 he has four hundred dollars wrapped up in newspaper in theventilation of the privy this is timofei kvastsov speaking a tenant of thesaid house apartment no 11  but i adjure you to keep my name  a secret ifear the vengeance of the abovestated chairman     and he hung up the scoundrel     what happened next  in apartment no50  is  not known but it is  knownwhat  happened  at nikanor ivanovichs having  locked  himself in the privywith the  hook  he took  from his briefcase  the wad foisted  on him by theinterpreter
and  satisfied himself that it  contained  four hundred roublesnikanor ivanovich wrapped this  wad in a scrap  of newspaper and put it intothe ventilation duct     five minutes later the chairman was sitting  at the table  in his smalldining  room  his wife  brought  pickled herring from  the kitchen  neatlysliced  and  thickly  sprinkled  with green onion  nikanor ivanovich pouredhimself a dram of vodka drank it poured another drank it picked up threepieces of herring  on his fork     and at that moment the doorbell  rangpelageya antonovna was just bringing in a steaming pot which one could tellat once from a single glance  contained amidst a  fiery borscht that thanwhich there is nothing more delicious in the world  a marrow bone     swallowing his spittle nikanor ivanovich growled like a dog     damn them all wont  allow a man to  eat  dont let anyone in imnot  here  not  here   if its about the  apartment  tell them  to stopblathering therell be a meeting next week    
his wife ran to the front hall while nikanor ivanovich using a ladledrew from the firebreathing  lake  it the  bone cracked lengthwise andat that moment two citizens entered the dining room with pelageya antonovnafollowing  them for  some reason looking  very pale  seeing  the citizensnikanor ivanovich also turned white and stood up     wheres the jakes the first  one  in  a white sidebuttoned  shirtasked with a preoccupied air     something thudded against the dining table this was  nikanor ivanovichdropping the ladle on to the oilcloth     this way this way pelageya antonovna replied in a patter     and the visitors immediately hastened to the corridor     whats  the  matter nikanor ivanovich asked quiedy going  after thevisitors there  cant be anything like  that in our apartment    and your papers    begging your pardon        the first without stopping showed nikanor ivanovich a paper  and thesecond  was  at the same moment standing on a stool in the privy

the briefcase glanced into it put  a hand inside went bluein the face  and dropped the briefcase into the borscht  there was nothingin  the  briefcase no letter  from  styopa  no  contract  no  foreignerspassport  no money no theatre  pass  in short nothing except  a  foldingruler     comrades  the  chairman  cried frenziedly  catch  them there  areunclean powers in our house     it is not known what pelageya antonovna imagined here only she claspedher hands and cried     repent ivanych youll get off lighter     his  eyes bloodshot nikanor ivanovich raised his fists over his wifeshead croaking     ohh you damned fool     here he  went slack and  sank down  on  a chair  evidendy resolved  tosubmit to the inevitable     during this time timofei  kondratievich kvastsov stood on the landingplacing  now  his ear  now his  eye to the  keyhole  of  the  door  to  thechairmans apartment melting with curiosity     five  minutes later the tenants of the house  who were in the
courtyardsaw the chairman accompanied by two other persons  proceed directly to thegates  of  the house it  was  said  that  nikanor  ivanovich looked  awfulstaggered like a drunk man as he passed and was muttering something     and an hour after that an unknown citizen appeared in apartment no 11just as timofei kondratievich spluttering  with delight  was telling  someother   tenants  how   the  chairman   got  pinched  motioned  to   timofeikondratievich  with his finger  to come from the kitchen  to the front hallsaid something to him and together they vanished

chapter 10 news from yalta       at the same rime that  disaster struck nikanor ivanovich not far awayfrom no502bis on the same sadovaya street in the office of the financialdirector of the  variety theatre rimsky there sat two men rimsky himselfand the administrator of the variety varenukha     the big office  on the second floor of  the theatre  had two windows onsadovaya and one just  behind the back  of the findirector who was sittingat his  desk  facing  the  summer garden of  the  variety where there wererefreshment   stands  a  shooting  gallery  and  an  openair  stage   thefurnishings of the office apart from the desk consisted  of a bunch of oldposters  hanging on the  wall a small  table with  a carafe of water on itfour  armchairs and in the corner a  stand  on which stood  a dustcoveredscale model  of some  past review well  it  goes without  saying  that inaddition there  was  in the office a small shabby peeling fireproof safeto rimskys left next to the desk     rimsky now sitting
at his desk had been in bad spirits since morningwhile varenukha on  the contrary  was very animated and somehow especiallyrestlessly active yet there was no outlet for his energy     varenukha was presently  hiding in the findirectors office to  escapethe seekers of free passes who  poisoned  his life especially on days whenthe programme changed  and today  was  precisely such a day as soon as thetelephone started to ring  varenukha would  pick up the receiver  and  lieinto it     who varenukha hes not here he stepped out please call likhodeevagain rimsky asked vexedly hes not home i even sent karpov theres noone  in  the  apartment  devil  knows whats going on  rimisky  hissedclacking on the adding machine     the  door opened  and an  usher dragged  in  a  thick stack of  freshlyprinted extra posters in big red letters on a green background was printed     today and every day at the variety theatre     an additional programme     professor woland     seances of black
magic and its full exposure     varenukha stepped back from  the poster which he had thrown  on to thescale model admired it and told  the  usher  to send  all the  posters outimmediately to be pasted up     good    loud varenukha observed on the ushers departure     and  i  dislike this undertaking extremely rimsky grumbled glancingspitefully at the poster through his hornrimmed glasses and generally imsurprised hes been allowed to present it     no grigory danilovich dont say so this  is  a very subde step thesalt is all in the exposure     i  dont know  i  dont know theres no salt in my opinion   andhes always coming  up with  things like this  he might at least show ushis magician have you seen him where he dug him up devil knows     it turned out  that varenukha had not seen  the  magician any more thanrimsky had yesterday styopa  had  come running  like crazy  in rimskysexpression to the findirector with the already written draft of a contractordered
it copied straight away  and  the  money handed  over to woland andthis  magician  had cleared  out  and no  one had seen  him  except  styopahimself     rimsky took out his  watch saw that it read five minutes past two andflew into  a complete  rage really likhodeev had  called at around elevensaid  hed come  in  half an  hour  and  not  only  had  not come but  haddisappeared from his apartment     hes holding up my  business rimsky  was  roaring  now  jabbing hisfinger at a pile of unsigned papers     might he have fallen under a tramcar like berlioz varenukha said ashe held his ear to the  receiver from which came low prolonged and utterlyhopeless signals     wouldnt be a bad  thing   rimsky said barely  audibly through histeeth     at that same moment a  woman  in a uniform  jacket visored cap  blackskirt and sneakers came  into the office from a small pouch at her belt thewoman took a small white square and a notebook and asked     who  here is variety  a superlightning
telegram  signhere     varenukha scribbled some flourish in the womans notebook and  as soonas  the door slammed behind  her he  opened  the square after  reading thetelegram he blinked and handed the square to rimsky     the  telegram contained the following yalta  to moscow variety todayeleven  thirty  brownhaired  man  came  criminal  investigation  nightshirttrousers shoeless  mental  case gave  name likhodeev director  variety  wireyalta criminal investigation where director likhodeev     hello  and how  do  you  do  rimsky exclaimed and  added  anothersurprise     a false dmitri said varenukha  and he spoke into  thereceiver  telegraph   office  variety  account   take  a  superlightningtelegram  are  you  listening  yalta  criminal  investigation   directorlikhodeev moscow findirector rimsky     irrespective  of  the news  about  the  yalta impostor varenukha againbegan searching all over for styopa by telephone and naturally did not findhim anywhere    
just as varenukha  receiver in hand was pondering where else he mightcall the same  woman who had brought the first telegram came  in and handedvarenukha a  new envelope opening it hurriedly varenukha read the  messageand whistled     what now rimsky asked twitching nervously     varenukha  silently  handed  him the  telegram and the findirector sawthere the words beg  believe thrown  yalta  woland hypnosis  wire criminalinvestigation confirm identity likhodeev     rimsky  and varenukha their  heads touching reread  the telegram andafter rereading it silently stared at each other     citizens the woman got angry  sign and then be  silent as much asyou like i deliver lightnings     varenukha without taking his eyes  off the  telegram  made  a crookedscrawl in the notebook and the woman vanished     didnt you talk with him on  the phone at a little past  eleven  theadministrator began in total bewilderment     no its  ridiculous rimsky cried shrilly talk or  not he cant
bein yalta now its ridiculous     hes drunk    said varenukha     whos drunk asked rimsky and again the two stared at each other     that some  impostor or madman had  sent telegrams from yalta there wasno doubt but the  strange thing was this  how did the yalta mystifier knowwoland  who had come to moscow  just the  day before how did he know aboutthe connection between likhodeev and woland     hypnosis     varenukha kept repeating the  word from the telegramhow does he  know  about  woland he blinked  his eyes  and suddenly criedresolutely ah no nonsense   nonsense nonsense     wheres he staying this woland devil take him asked rimsky     varenukha  immediately got  connected with the  foreign tourist  bureauand to rimskys utter  astonishment announced  that  woland was staying inlikhodeevs apartment  dialling the number of the likhodeev apartment afterthat varenukha listened for a long time to the low buzzing in the receiveramidst the  buzzing  from
somewhere far away came  a  heavy gloomy  voicesinging    rocks my refuge     and varenukha decidedthat the telephone lines had crossed with a voice from a radio show     the  apartment  doesnt  answer  varenukha  said  putting  down  thereceiver or maybe i should call     he  did not finish the same  woman appeared in the door and both menrimsky and varenukha  rose to meet her while she took from her pouch not awhite sheet this time but some sort of dark one     this  is  beginning  to  get interesting  varenukha said through  histeeth  his eyes following the  hurriedly  departing  woman  rimsky was thefirst to take hold of the sheet     on  a dark  background of  photographic  paper  some black handwrittenlines were barely discernible     proof my  handwriting  my signature  wire urgendy  confirmation  placesecret watch woland likhodeev     in his twenty  years  of  work in the  theatre varenukha had seen  allkinds of sights but here he felt his mind becoming obscured
as with a veiland he could find nothing to say but the at once mundane and  utterly absurdphrase     this cannot be     rimsky acted otherwise he stood up opened the door barked out to themessenger girl sitting on a stool     let no one in except postmen  and locked the door with a key     then he took a pile of papers  out of the desk  and began carefully  tocompare the bold backslanting letters of the photogram with the letters instyopas resolutions and  signatures  furnished  with a corkscrew flourishvarenukha  leaning his weight  on the table  breathed  hotly  on  rimskyscheek     its  his  handwriting  the  findirector finally  said  firmly  andvarenukha repeated like an echo     his     peering  into rimskys face the administrator marvelled at  the changethat had come over  this face thin to begin with the findirector seemed tohave grown still thinner and even older hi eyes in their hornrims  had lost their  customary prickliness and there appeared in  them notonly
alarm but even sorrow     varenukha did everything  that a man in a moment of  great astonishmentought to do he raced  up and down the office he raised his arms twice likeone crucified he drank a whole glass of yellowish water from the carafe andexclaimed     i dont understand i dont understand i dont understand     rimsky  meanwhile was  looking  out  the  window  thinking hard  aboutsomething the  findirectors  position was very difficult it was necessaryat   once   right  on  the   spot  to  invent  ordinary  explanations  forextraordinary phenomena     narrowing his eyes the  findirector  pictured to himself  styopa in anightshirt and  shoeless  getting into some  unprecedented superhighspeedairplane at around  half past eleven that morning and then the same styopaalso at half past eleven  standing in  his stocking feet at the airport  inyalta    devil knew what to make of it     maybe it was not styopa who talked with him this morning over the phonefrom his own apartment
no  it was styopa  speaking who if  not he  shouldknow styopas voice and even if it was not styopa speaking today it was noearlier  than yesterday towards  evening  that styopa  had  come  from hisoffice  to this  very office  with this idiotic  contract  and  annoyed  thefindirector with his lightmindedness how could he have  gone or flown awaywithout leaving  word at  the  theatre but if he  had flown away  yesterdayevening  he would not have arrived by noon today or would he     how many miles is it to yalta asked rimsky     varenukha stopped his running and yelled     i thought of  that i  already diought of it by train its  over ninehundred miles to sebastopol  plus another fifty to yalta well but by airof course its less     hm   yes    there could be no question  of  any trains but  whatthen some fighter plane  who would let styopa on any fighter plane withouthis shoes what for  maybe he took his shoes off when he got to yalta itsthe  same thing what for and even
with his shoes on they wouldnt have lethim on a fighter and what has the fighter  got to do with  it its writtenthat he came to the investigators at half past eleven in the morning and hetalked  on the telephone in moscow   excuse me   the face of rimskyswatch emerged before his eyes     rimsky tried to remember where the hands had been   terrible it hadbeen twenty minutes past eleven     so  what  does it  boil  down  to  if  one  supposes  that  after  theconversation styopa instantly rushed to the airport and reached it in sayfive minutes which incidentally was also unthinkable it  means mat  dieplane taking off at once covered nearly a thousand miles  in five minutesconsequently it was flying at twelve thousand miles an hour that  cannotbe and that means hes not in yalta     what remains then hypnosis theres no hypnosis in the world that canfling a man a  thousand miles away so hes imagining that hes in yalta hemay  be imagining it but are the yalta investigators
also imagining it nono sorry that cant be yet they did telegraph from there     the findirectors face was literally  dreadful the door handle was allthe while being turned and pulled from outside and the messenger girl couldbe heard through the door crying desperately     impossible i wont let you cut me to pieces its a meeting     rimsky  regained  control  of himself  as  well  as he could  took diereceiver of the phone and said into it     a superurgent call to yalta please     clever varenukha observed mentally     but  the conversation with yalta did not take place rimsky hung up thereceiver and said     as luck would have it the lines broken     it could be  seen that the broken  line  especially  upset him for somereason and  even made him  lapse into diought having diought  a little heagain  took die receiver in one hand and with  the other began writing downwhat he said into it     take  a superlightning variety  yes  yalta criminal  investigationyes
today around eleven thirty likhodeev talked me phone moscow stop afterthat did not  come work unable locate by phone stop confirm handwriting stoptaking measures watch said artiste findirector rimsky     very clever thought varenukha but before he had time to think wellthe words rushed through his head stupid he cant be in yalta     rimsky  meanwhile did the following he neatly stacked all the receivedtelegrams plus the copy of his own put the stack into an  envelope sealedit wrote a few words on it and handed it to varenukha saying     go     right     now     ivan    savelyevich    take    it     therepersonally let them sort it out     now that is really clever thought varenukha and he put the envelopeinto his briefcase then just in case he dialled styopas apartment numberon  the  telephone listened and  began winking and  grimacing joyfully andmysteriously rimsky stretched his neck     may i speak with the artiste woland varenukha asked sweetly     misters 
busy  the  receiver answered in  a rattling voice  whoscalling     the administrator of the variety varenukha     ivan  savelyevich the receiver cried out joyfully terribly  glad tohear your voice howre you doing     merci varenukha replied in amazement and with whom am i speaking     his assistant his assistant  and interpreter koroviev crackled thereceiver im entirely at your service my  dearest ivan savelyevich orderme around as you like and so     excuse  me but   what is stepan bogdanovich likhodeev not at homenow     alas no no the receiver shouted he left     for where     out of town for a drive in the car     wh  what a dr   drive and when will he be back     he said ill get a breath of fresh air and come back     so    said the puzzled varenukha merci  kindly tell  monsieurwoland that his performance is tonight in the third part of the programme     right of course absolutely urgently without fail  ill tell

     its nonsense  his  own  little jokes  the  expansive administratorinterrupted and asked shall i take the envelope     absolutely replied rimsky     and again  the  door opened and in  came that same    her thoughtrimsky  for some reason with  anguish  and  both  men  rose  to  meet  thepostwoman     this time the telegram contained the words     thank  you   confirmation   send   five   hundred   urgently   criminalinvestigation my name tomorrow fly moscow likhodeev     hes lost his mind    varenukha said weakly     rimsky jingled his key took money from the fireproof safe counted outfive  hundred roubles rang the  bell handed the messenger  the  money andsent him to the telegraph office     good heavens grigory danilovich  varenukha said not  believing hiseyes in my opinion you oughtnt to send the money     itll come  back rimsky replied quietly but hell have a hard timeexplaining  this little picnic and he added  indicating the briefcase  tovarenukha
go ivan savelyevich dont delay     and varenukha ran out of the office with the briefcase     he went  down to  the ground  floor  saw the longest  line at  the boxoffice  found  out  from  the boxoffice girl that she expected to sell outwithin  the  hour because  the  public was  simply  pouring  in  since  theadditional poster had been put up told the girl to earmark and hold  thirtyof  the  best seats in the gallery and  the stalls  popped out  of the  boxoffice shook off importunate  passseekers as  he  ran and  dived into hislittle office to get his cap at that moment the telephone ratded     yes varenukha shouted     ivan savelyevich the  receiver inquired in a  most  repulsive  nasalvoice     hes not in the  theatre  varenukha was  shouting but  the receiverinterrupted him at once     dont play the fool ivan savelyevich just listen  do not take thosetelegrams anywhere or show them to anyone     who is this  varenukha bellowed  stop these jokes citizen youllbe
found out at once whats your number     varenukha the same nasty voice returned do you understand russiandont take the telegrams anywhere     ah so  you wont stop the administrator cried furiously look outthen youre going to pay  for it  he  shouted some other threat but fellsilent because he sensed that no one was listening to him any longer in thereceiver     here it somehow began to grow  dark very quickly in his little  officevarenukha ran out slammed the door behind him and rushed through the  sideentrance into the summer garden     the administrator was agitated and full  of energy after  the insolentphone  call he had no  doubts that it  was a band of hooligans playing nastytricks and  that  these tricks  were connected with  the  disappearance  oflikhodeev  the  administrator  was choking  with  the desire to expose  themalefactors and strange as it was the anticipation of something enjoyablewas born in him it happens that way when a man strives to become the centreof
attention to bring sensational news somewhere     in the  garden the wind blew in the administrators face and flung sandin his eyes as if blocking his way as if cautioning him  a window on  thesecond floor slammed so that the glass nearly broke  the tops of the maplesand  lindens  rustled   alarmingly  it   became  darker   and  colder  theadministrator rubbed his  eyes and saw that a yellowbellied storm cloud wascreeping low over moscow there came a dense distant rumbling     however great varenukhas hurry an irrepressible desire pulled  at himto run over to the summer  toilet for a second on his way to check  whetherthe repairman had put a wire screen over the lightbulb     running past the  shooting gallery varenukha came to a thick growth oflilacs where  the lightblue toilet building stood the repairman turned outto  be an efficient fellow the bulb under the roof of the  gentlemens sidewas covered with a wire screen but the administrator was upset that even inthe  prestorm  darkness 
one could  make  out that the  walls were  alreadywritten all over in charcoal and pencil     well what sort of   the administrator began and  suddenly heard avoice purring behind him     is that you ivan savelyevich     varenukha started turned around and  saw before him  a short fat manwith what seemed to him a catlike physiognomy     so its me varenukha answered hostilely     very  very  glad the catlike fat man responded in a  squeaky voiceand suddenly swinging his arm gave varenukha such a blow on  the  ear thatthe  cap flew off the administrators head and vanished without a trace downthe hole in the seat     at  the  fat  mans blow the whole  toilet lit  up momentarily with  atremulous light and a  roll of thunder echoed in the sky then came anotherflash and a second man emerged before  the administrator  short but  withathletic shoulders hair red as fire albugo in one eye a fang in his mouth   this second  one evidently a lefty socked  the administrator on 
theother ear in response there  was another roll  of  thunder  in the sky andrain poured down on the wooden roof of the toilet     what  is  it  comr    the  halfcrazed  administrator  whisperedrealized at once that the word comrades hardly  fitted bandits attacking aman in a public  toilet rasped out citiz     figured  that they didnot  merit this appellation either and received a third  terrible blow fromhe did not know which of them so that blood gushed from his nose on  to histolstoy blouse     what you got in  the  briefcase  parasite the  one resembling a catcried shrilly telegrams werent  you  warned over the  phone not to  takethem anywhere werent you warned im asking you     i  was  wor  wer   warned      the  administrator  answeredsuffocating     and  you skipped off anyway  gimme the briefcase vermin the secondone  cried in the same nasal voice that had  come over the telephone and heyanked the briefcase from varenukhas trembling hands    
and the two picked the administrator up under the arms dragged him outof the  garden and raced down  sadovaya with him the  storm  raged at fullforce  water streamed  with  a noise and  howling  down  the  drains wavesbubbled  and  billowed  everywhere water  gushed  from  the roofs  past thedrainpipes  foamy streams  ran from gateways everything living  got washedoff sadovaya and there was no one to save ivan savelyevich leaping throughmuddy rivers under flashes of lightning the bandits dragged the halfaliveadministrator in a  split  second  to  no502bis flew with him through thegateway  where two barefoot  women holding  their shoes and  stockings  intheir hands pressed themselves to the wall then they dashed into the sixthentrance and varenukha nearly  insane was taken up to the fifth floor andthrown  down in  the  semidark front hall so well known to him  of styopalikhodeevs apartment     here the two robbers vanished and in their place there appeared in thefront hall a completely

to  the  police  from massolit  member ivan  nikolaevich  homeless  astatement  yesterday  evening  i came  to the  patriarchs  ponds with  thedeceased m a berlioz       and  right there  the  poet  got  confused mainly  owing  to  the worddeceased  some nonsensicality  emerged at once whats this   came withthe deceased the deceased dont go  anywhere really for all he knew theymight take him for a madman     having reflected  thus  ivan nikolaevich  began to correct what he hadwritten  what  came  out  this  time  was       with  m  a  berliozsubsequently deceased    this did not satisfy the author either he  hadto have recourse to  a third  redaction which proved still worse  than  thefirst two berlioz who fell  under the tramcar    and that  namesakecomposer unknown to anyone  was also dangling here so he had to  put innot the composer        after suffering over these two berliozes ivan  crossed it  all out anddecided to begin right off with  something
very strong in order  to attractthe  readers  attention  at once so  he  wrote  that a  cat had  got on  atramcar and then went back to the episode with the severed head the  headand  the consultants  prediction led  him to the thought of pontius pilateand for  greater  conviction  ivan  decided  to tell  the whole story of theprocurator  in full from the moment  he walked out in his white cloak  withbloodred lining to the colonnade of herods palace     ivan  worked assiduously crossing out what he had written  putting innew words and even attempted to draw pontius pilate and then a cat standingon its  hind  legs but the  drawings did not help and the further it wentthe more confusing and incomprehensible the poets statement became     by the time the frightening cloud with smoking edges appeared from  faroff and covered the woods and the wind began to blow ivan felt that he wasstrengthless that he would never be able to manage with the statement  andhe  would not pick up the scattered pages
and he wept quietly and bitterlythe  goodnatured nurse praskovya fyodorovna visited  the  poet  during  thestorm became alarmed on seeing him  weeping closed the  blinds so that thelightning  would  not frighten the patient  picked up the  pages  from  thefloor and ran with them for the doctor     he came gave  ivan an injection in the  arm and  assured him that  hewould not weep any  more that everything would  pass  now everything wouldchange everything would be forgotten     the  doctor proved  right  soon  the  woods across the river became asbefore it was outlined to the last tree under the sky which cleared to itsformer perfect blue and the  river  grew calm anguish  had begun to  leaveivan right after the injection and  now the  poet  lay calmly and looked atthe rainbow that stretched across the sky     so it  went till evening  and he  did not  even notice how the rainbowmelted away how the sky saddened and faded how the woods turned black     having drunk  some hot milk ivan lay
down again and  marvelled himselfat how changed his thinking was the  accursed demonic cat somehow softenedin  his  memory  the  severed head did  not  frighten  him  any more  andabandoning all thought of it ivan  began to  reflect  that essentially itwas not so bad in the clinic that stravinsky was a  clever man and a famousone  and it was quite pleasant to deal with him besides  the  evening airwas sweet and fresh after the storm     the house of sorrow was  falling asleep in quiet corridors the frostedwhite lights went out and in  their place according to regulations  faintblue nightlights were lit and the careful steps  of  attendants were heardmore and more rarely on the rubber matting of the corridor outside the door     now ivan  lay in sweet languor  glancing at the lamp  under its shadeshedding a softened light from  the ceiling then at the moon  rising behindthe black woods and conversed with himself     why  actually  did i get so  excited  about  berlioz falling under atramcar
the poet reasoned in  the final analysis let him sink what ami in  fact his chum or inlaw if we air the question  properly  it turnsout that in essence i really did not even know the deceased what indeeddid i know about him nothing except that he was bald and terribly eloquentand furthermore citizens ivan continued his speech addressing someone orother  lets  sort  this  out  why tell  me  did i get furious  at thismysterious consultant magician and professor with the black and  empty eyewhy  all this  absurd chase after him in underpants and with  a candle in myhand and then those wild shenanigans in the restaurant     uhuhuh the  former  ivan suddenly  said sternly  somewhere eitherinside  or over his  ear  to  the new  ivan he  did  know beforehand thatberliozs head would be cut off didnt he how could i not get excited     what are  we talking  about comrades the  new ivan objected  to theold former ivan that things  are not  quite  proper here even a child
canunderstand  hes  a onehundredpercent outstanding and mysterious personbut  thats  the most interesting thing  the man was  personally acquaintedwith pontius pilate what could be more  interesting than that and insteadof  raising  a  stupid  rumpus  at  the ponds wouldnt  it  have  been moreintelligent  to question him  politely about what  happened further  on withpilate  and his  prisoner hanozri  and i started devil knows what a majoroccurrence really  a  magazine editor gets run over and  so what is themagazine going to shut down for that well what can  be done  about it manis mortal and as has rightly  been said unexpectedly mortal well  may herest  in  peace  well so therell be  another  editor and maybe even moreeloquent than the previous one     after  dozing  for  a  while  the  new   ivan  asked   the  old   ivansarcastically     and what does it make me in that case     a fool a bass voice said distinctly somewhere a voice not belongingto either of the ivans
and extremely like the bass of the consultant     ivan for  some reason not  offended  by  the  word  fool  but  evenpleasantly  surprised  at  it  smiled  and drowsily grew  quiet  sleep wasstealing  over  ivan  and  he  was  already  picturing a  palm tree on  itselephants leg and a cat passing by  not scary but merry  and in shortsleep  was  just about to  come  over  ivan when the  grille suddenly movednoiselessly aside and  a  mysterious figure appeared on the balcony hidingfrom the moonlight and shook its finger at ivan     not frightened in the least ivan sat  up in bed and saw that there wasa  man  on  the balcony  and  this  man  pressing  a finger  to  his lipswhispered     shhh

chapter 12 black magic and its exposure       a  small  man  in  a  yellow  bowlerhat  full  of  holes  and  with  apearshaped   raspberrycoloured   nose   in   checkered    trousers   andpatentleather  shoes rolled out  on  to the  stage  of the variety  on  anordinary twowheeled  bicycle to the sounds of a foxtrot  he made a circleand then gave a triumphant shout which caused his bicycle to rear up afterriding  around  on  the  back wheel  the little  man  turned  upside  downcontrived while in motion to unscrew the front wheel and  send it backstageand then proceeded  on his  way with one wheel turning the pedals  with hishands     on a tall metal pole with a seat at the top and a single wheel a plumpblonde rolled out in tights and a little skirt strewn with silver stars andbegan  riding in a circle as  he met  her the little man uttered cries  ofgreeting doffing his bowlerhat with his foot     finally a little eightyearold with an elderly face came  rolling outand  began scooting  about among the adults on a
tiny twowheeler  furnishedwith an enormous automobile horn     after  making  several  loops  the  whole  company  to  the  alarmingdrumbeats of the  orchestra rolled to the  very edge of the stage and thespectators in the front rows  gasped and drew back because it seemed to thepublic that the whole trio with  its vehicles was about to  crash  down intothe orchestra pit     but the  bicycles stopped  just  at  the moment  when the front  wheelsthreatened to slide into the abyss  on the heads of the  musicians  with  aloud shout of hup the cyclists jumped off their vehicles  and  bowed theblonde woman blowing kisses  to  the public  and the little one  tooting  afunny signal on his horn     applause  shook the  building the lightblue  curtain  came from  bothsides and covered the cyclists  the green exit  lights by  the doors wentout and in the web of trapezes under the  cupola white spheres lit up  likethe sun it was die intermission before die last part     the only man who was not the
least bit interested in the wonders of thegiulli familys cycling technique was grigory danilovich rimsky     in complete  solitude  he sat  in his office biting  his thin lips  aspasm  passing  over  his  face  from  time  to time  to  the extraordinarydisappearance  of  likhodeev  had  now  been  added  the  wholly  unforeseendisappearance of varenukha     rimsky knew where he had gone but he had gone and    not come backrimsky shrugged his shoulders and whispered to himself     but what for     and it was strange for such a  practical man  as the findirector  thesimplest thing would of course have been to call the place where varenukhahad  gone  and  find out  what had  befallen him  yet until  ten oclock atnighthe had been unable to force himself to do it     at  ten  doing outright  violence to  himself rimsky  picked  up  thereceiver  and  here  discovered  that his telephone was dead the  messengerreported that the other telephones in  the building were  also out of orderthis certainly
unpleasant though  hardly supernatural  occurrence for somereason thoroughly shocked the findirector but at the same time he was gladthe need to call fell away     just as the  red light over the findirectors head  lit up and blinkedannouncing the  beginning  of  the  intermission a  messenger  came in  andinformed him of the  foreign artistes arrival the  findirector cringed forsome reason and blacker than a storm  cloud went backstage to receive thevisitor since there was no one else to receive him     under  various  pretexts  curious  people  kept  peeking into the  bigdressing room from the  corridor where the signal bell was already ringingamong them were conjurers in bright robes and  turbans a skater in a  whiteknitted jacket a storyteller pale with powder and the makeup man     the newly arrived celebrity  struck  everyone by  his marvellously  cuttailcoat  of a length  never seen before and by his having come in a blackhalfmask  but  most  remarkable  of  all were  the  black 
magicians  twocompanions a  long checkered one with  a cracked pincenez and a fat blackcat who came into the dressing room on his hind legs  and quite nonchalantlysat on the sofa squinting at the bare makeup lights     rimsky  attempted to produce a smile on his face  which  made it  looksour and spiteful and bowed to the silent black magician who was seated onthe sofa beside  the  cat there was  no  handshake instead  the easygoingcheckered one  made  his  own  introductions  to  the  findirector callinghimself the gents assistant this circumstance surprised the findirectorand unpleasantly so there was decidedly no mention of any assistant in  thecontract     quite  stiffly   and  drily  grigory  danilovich   inquired   of  thisfallenfromthesky checkered one where the artistes paraphernalia was     our heavenly diamond most  precious mister director the  magiciansassistant replied in a rattling voice the paraphernalia is always with ushere it is ein zwei drei and waving
his knotty fingers before rimskyseyes he suddenly took from behind the cats ear rimskys own gold watch andchain hitherto worn by the findirector in his  waistcoat pocket under  hisbuttoned coat with the chain through a buttonhole     rimsky  inadvertently clutched his  stomach those  present gasped andthe makeup man peeking in the doorway grunted approvingly     tour  little watchie kindly take it the checkered  one said smilingcasually and offering  the bewildered rimsky  his  own  property  on a dirtypalm     no getting on a tram with that one the storyteller whispered quietlyand merrily to the makeup man     but the cat  pulled a neater  trick  than  the number  with the  stolenwatch getting up from the sofa unexpectedly  he walked on his hind legs tothe dressing table pulled the stopper out of the carafe with his front pawpoured water into a glass drank it installed the stopper in its place andwiped his whiskers with a makeup cloth     here no one even gasped their mouths simply
fell open and the makeupman whispered admiringly     thats class     just  then the bells rang alarmingly for  the third time and everyoneagitated  and  anticipating  an interesting  number  thronged  out  of  thedressing room     a moment  later  the spheres went out  in the  theatre the  footlightsblazed up  lending  a reddish  glow to the base of the curtain and  in thelighted gap of  the curtain there appeared before the public  a  plump  manmerry  as  a  baby  with  a cleanshaven face  in  a rumpled tailcoat  andnonetoofresh shirt this was the master of ceremonies well  known  to allmoscow  georges bengalsky     and now citizens bengalsky began smiling his baby smile there isabout to come  before you  here bengalsky interrupted himself and  spokein a different tone i see the audience has grown for the third part wevegot  half the city here i met a friend the  other day and said to him whydont you come to our show yesterday we had half the city and he 
says tome  i live in  the other half bengalsky  paused waiting for a burst oflaughter but as  no one  laughed he went on    and so  now comes thefamous foreign artiste monsieur woland with a seance of black magic wellboth you and i know  here bengalsky  smiled a wise smile that theres nosuch  thing in  the world and that its all just superstition  and maestrowoland is simply a perfect master of the technique of conjuring as we shallsee from the most interesting part that is the exposure of this techniqueand since were all of  us to a man both for technique and for its exposurelets bring on mr woland      after uttering all this claptrap bengalsky pressed  his palms togetherand waved them in greeting through the slit of  the curtain which caused itto part with a soft rustic     the entrance of the magician with his  long assistant and the cat  whocame on stage on his hind legs pleased the audience greatly     an armchair  for  me woland  ordered in  a low 
voice and that samesecond an armchair appeared  on  stage no  one  knew  how or from where inwhich the magician sat down tell me my gentle fagott woland inquired ofthe  checkered clown who  evidently had another appellation than  korovievwhat  do you think  the  moscow populace has changed significantly hasntit     the  magician  looked  out  at  the  hushed  audience  struck  by  theappearance of the armchair out of nowhere     that it has messire fagottkoroviev replied in a low voice     youre right the  city folk have  changed greatly      externallythat is  as has the city itself incidentally    not  to mention theirclothing these   what do you call them    trams automobiles  haveappeared     buses  fagott prompted deferentially     the  audience listened attentively to  this  conversation  thinking itconstituted  a  prelude  to the magic  tricks  the wings  were  packed withperformers and stagehands and among  their faces could be  seen
the tensepale face of rimsky     the physiognomy of  bengalsky  who  had retreated  to the side of  thestage began  to  show  some perplexity he raised one eyebrow slighdy  andtaking advantage of a pause spoke     the  foreign artiste is expressing his admiration  for moscow and  itstechnological development as  well as for  the  muscovites here bengalskysmiled twice first to the stalls then to the gallery     woland fagott and the cat  turned their heads  in the direction of themaster of ceremonies     did i express admiration the magician asked the checkered fagott     by no  means  messire you never expressed  any admiration came thereply     then what is the man saying     he quite  simply lied the  checkered assistant declared  sonorouslyfor the whole theatre to hear and turning to bengalsky he added     congrats citizen you done lied     tittering spattered  from the  gallery but bengalsky gave a  start andgoggled his eyes     of course im not so much interested
in buses telephones and other       apparatuses the checkered one prompted     quite right thank you the magician  spoke slowly  in a  heavy bassas  in  a  question of much  greater importance have the city folk changedinwardly     yes that is the most important question sir     there  was  shrugging  and  an  exchanging  of  glances  in  the wingsbengalsky stood  all red and rimsky was pale  but  here as if sensing thenascent alarm the magician said     however were  talking  away my  dear fagott and  the  audience  isbeginning to get bored my gende fagott show us some simple little thing tostart with     the audience stirred fagott and the cat walked along the footlights toopposite  sides  of  the  stage  fagott snapped  his fingers  and  with  arollicking three four snatched a deck of cards from the air shuffled itand sent it in a long ribbon to the cat the cat intercepted it and  sent itback the satiny snake whiffled fagott opened his mouth like a nestling
andswallowed it all card by card after which the cat bowed scraping his righthind paw winning himself unbelievable applause     class real class rapturous shouts came from the wings     and fagott jabbed his finger at the stalls and announced     youll find that same deck esteemed  citizens  on citizen parchevskyin the seventh row just between a threerouble bill and  a summons to courtin connection with the payment of alimony to citizen zeikova     there was a stirring in the stalls people began to get up and finallysome citizen whose name  was  indeed parchevsky all crimson with amazementextracted  the deck from his wallet and began sticking it up in the air notknowing what to do with it     you may keep it as a souvenir cried fagott not for nothing did yousay at dinner  yesterday that if it werent for poker  your  life  in moscowwould be utterly unbearable     an  old trick came from the gallery the one  in  the stalls is fromthe same company     you think so shouted fagott
squinting at the gallery in that caseyoure also one of us because the deck is now in your pocket     there was movement in the balcony and a joyful voice said     right hes got it here here    wait its tenrouble bills     those  sitting in  the stalls turned  their  heads in  the  gallery  abewildered  citizen found in his  pocket  a  bankwrapped packet  with  onethousand roubles written on it his neighbours hovered over him and he inamazement picked at  the wrapper with his fingernail trying to find out ifthe bills were real or some sort of magic ones     by god theyre real  tenrouble  bills  joyful cries came from thegallery     i want to play with the same kind of deck a fat man in the middle ofthe stalls requested merrily     avec  playzeer  fagott responded but  why just you everyone  willwarmly participate  and he commanded look up please     one therewas  a pistol in his hand he shouted two the pistol was  pointed up heshouted three there
was a flash a bang and all at once from under thecupola bobbing between  the trapezes white strips of  paper  began fallinginto the theatre     they twirled got blown aside were drawn  towards the gallery bouncedinto the orchestra and on to the stage in a few seconds the rain of moneyever  thickening  reached the  seats and the spectators began snatching atit     hundreds  of arms were raised the spectators held the bills up to  thelighted stage and saw the most  true and honesttogod watermarks the smellalso left no  doubts it was the incomparably  delightful  smell of  freshlyprinted money the whole  theatre was seized first  with merriment  and thenwith amazement the word money money hummed everywhere there were gaspsof ah ah and  merry  laughter one or two were already  crawling  in theaisles  feeling under the chairs many stood on the seats  trying to catchthe flighty capricious notes     bewilderment was gradually coming  to  the faces of the  policemen andperformers unceremoniously
began sticking their heads out from the wings     in the dress circle a  voice was heard whatre  you grabbing at itsmine  it flew to me and another  voice  dont shove  me or youll  getshoved  back  and  suddenly there came the sound  of a  whack  at  once apolicemans helmet appeared in the  dress circle and someone from the dresscircle was led away     the  general  agitation was increasing  and no one knows where  it allwould have ended  if fagott had not  stopped the rain  of money  by suddenlyblowing into the air     two  young men exchanging significant and merry glances took off fromtheir seats  and  made  straight  for  the  buffet  there was a hum in  thetheatre  all the  spectators  eyes glittered excitedly  yes  yes no oneknows  where  it all  would  have ended if bengalsky had  not  summoned  hisstrength  and acted trying to gain better control of himself he rubbed hishands as was his custom and in his most resounding voice spoke thus     here citizens you  and  i
have just beheld a case of  socalled masshypnosis a purely scientific  experiment proving in the best way  possiblethat  there are  no  miracles in magic let us  ask maestro woland to exposethis experiment  for  us presendy  citizens  you will see these  supposedbanknotes disappear as suddenly as they appeared     here he  applauded but quite alone while a confident  smile played onhis  face  yet  in his eyes  there  was no such confidence  but  rather anexpression of entreaty     the audience did not like bengalskys speech total silence fell whichwas broken by the checkered fagott     and  this is a case  of  socalled  lying  he  announced in a  loudgoatish tenor the notes citizens are genuine     bravo a bass barked from somewhere on high     this one incidentally here  fagott pointed to bengalsky annoys mekeeps poking his nose where nobodys asked him spoils the seance with falseobservations whatre we going to do with him     tear his head off someone up in the gallery
said severely     whats that you said eh fagott responded at once to this outrageoussuggestion tear his head off theres an idea behemoth he shouted to thecat go to it bin zwei drei     and an  unheardof thing  occurred the fur bristled on the cats backand he gave a rending miaow then he compressed himself into a ball and shotlike a panther straight at bengalskys chest and from there on to his headgrowling the cat sank his  plump  paws into  the  skimpy  chevelure of  themaster  of ceremonies  and in two twists tore the head  from  the thick neckwith a savage howl     the  two and  a half thousand people in the  theatre cried out as  oneblood  spurted in fountains from the  torn neck arteries and poured over theshirtfront  and tailcoat  the  headless  body  paddled  its  feet  somehowabsurdly and sat down  on the floor hysterical womens  cries came from theaudience the  cat handed the head to fagott  who lifted it  up by the hairand showed it to  the  audience and the  head
cried desperately for all thetheatre to hear     a doctor     will you pour out such drivel in the future fagott asked the weepinghead menacingly     never again croaked the head     for gods sake dont torture  him  a womans voice  from a box seatsuddenly rose above the clamour and the magician turned in the direction ofthat voice     so  what  then  citizens  shall  we  forgive  him  fagott  askedaddressing the audience     forgive him forgive him  separate  voices  mostly  womens  spokefirst then merged into one chorus with the mens     what are your orders messire fagott asked the masked man     well now  the  latter replied pensively  theyre people  like anyother people    they love money but that  has always been so  mankindloves money  whatever its  made of  leather  paper bronze gold  welltheyre  lightminded    well what of it   mercy  sometimes knocks attheir hearts    ordinary people  in general reminiscent of the formerones

an exposurebut to that end will you allow me one more tiny number     why not arkady  apollonovich replied patronizingly but there  mustbe an exposure     very well  very well sir  and so allow me to ask  where were  youlast evening arkady apollonovich     at  this  inappropriate  and  perhaps  even  boorish  question  arkadyapollonovichs countenance changed and changed quite drastically     last  evening arkady  apollonovich was  at a meeting  of the acousticscommission arkady  apollonovichs  wife declared  very  haughtily but  idont understand what that has got to do with magic     ouee madame fagott agreed naturally you dont understand  as forthe meeting you are totally deluded after driving off to the said meetingwhich   incidentally  was  not   even   scheduled  for  last  night  arkadyapollonovich dismissed his chauffeur at the acoustics commission building onclean  ponds  the whole  theatre  became  hushed  and  went by  bus  toyelokhovskaya  street 
to  visit  an actress  from  the  regional  itineranttheatre militsa andreevna pokobatko with whom he spent some four hours     aie  someone cried  out  painfully  in  the  total  silence  arkadyapollonovichs young relation suddenly broke into a low and terrible laugh     its all clear she exclaimed and ive long suspected it now i seewhy that giftless thing got the role of louisa     and swinging suddenly she struck arkady apollonovich on the head withher short and fat violet umbrella     meanwhile the scoundrelly fagott alias koroviev was shouting     here  honourable  citizens  is  one  case  of  the  exposure  arkadyapollonovich so importunately insisted on     how dare  you touch arkady  apollonovich you  vile  creature arkadyapollonovichs wife  asked  threateningly  rising  in  the  box  to all hergigantic height     a second brief wave of satanic laughter seized the young relation whoelse should dare touch him she answered  guffawing if not  me and forthe second
time there came the dry crackling sound of the umbrella bouncingoff the head of arkady apollonovich     police  seize her  sempleyarovs wife shouted  in  such a terriblevoice that many hearts went cold     and here the cat  also leaped out to the footlights and suddenly barkedin a human voice for all the theatre to hear     the  seance is over  maestro  hack  out  a  march  the  halfcrazedconductor unaware  of what he was doing waved his baton and the orchestradid not play or even strike up or even bang away at but precisely in thecats  loathsome  expression  hacked  out  some   incredible  march  of  anunheardof brashness     for a  moment there was an illusion  of  having heard once upon a timeunder  southern  stars  in  a  cafechantant  some  barely   intelligiblehalfblind but rollicking words to this march     his excellency reached the stage     of liking barnyard fowl     he took under his patronage     three young girls and an owl     or maybe these were not  the words
at all but there were others to thesame music  extremely indecent  ones that is not the important  thing theimportant thing is that after all this something like babel broke loose inthe  variety the police  went  running to  sempleyarovs  box  people wereclimbing  over the  barriers  there  were bursts  of infernal guffawing andfurious shouts drowned in the golden clash of the orchestras cymbals     and one  could  see  that the stage was  suddenly empty and  that  thehoodwinker fagott as well as the brazen tomcat behemoth had  melted  intoair  vanished as the magician had vanished earlier in his armchair with thefaded upholstery

chapter 13 the hero enters       and so  the  unknown  man shook  his finger  at  ivan  and  whisperedshhh      ivan lowered his legs from the bed and  peered cautiously looking intothe  room  from  the   balcony  was  a  cleanshaven   darkhaired  man  ofapproximately  thirtyeight with a sharp nose anxious  eyes and a wisp ofhair hanging down on his forehead     having  listened and  made  sure  that ivan was  alone the  mysteriousvisitor took heart and stepped into the room here ivan saw that the man wasdressed  as a patient he  was wearing long underwear  slippers on his barefeet and a brown dressinggown thrown over his shoulders     the visitor winked at ivan hid a bunch of keys in his pocket inquiredin a whisper may i sit down   and receiving an affirmative nod placedhimself in an armchair     how did you get here ivan asked in a whisper obeying the dry fingershaken at him arent the balcony grilles locked     the grilles are locked the guest agreed  but  praskovya fyodorovnawhile
the  dearest person is also alas quite absentminded a month ago istole a bunch of keys from her and so gained the opportunity of getting outon  to  the common balcony which runs around the entire  floor  and  so ofoccasionally calling on a neighbour     if you can get out  on to the balcony  you  can escape or is it highup ivan was interested     no the guest replied firmly i cannot escape from here not becauseits high up but because i have nowhere to escape to and  he added aftera pause so here we sit     here  we sit  ivan replied  peering into the mans  brown and  veryrestless eyes     yes      here the guest suddenly became alarmed  but youre  notviolent i hope because you know i cannot stand noise turmoil force orother things like that especially hateful to me are peoples cries whethercries of  rage suffering or anything else set me at ease tell me yourenot violent     yesterday  in  a  restaurant  i  socked  one  type  in the  mug  thetransformed
poet courageously confessed     your grounds the guest asked sternly     no grounds i must confess ivan answered embarrassed     outrageous the  guest denounced ivan and added and besides what away to express yourself socked  in the mug   it is not known preciselywhether a man  has a mug or a  face and after all  it may well be a faceso you know using fists  no you should give that up and for good     having thus reprimanded ivan the guest inquired     your profession     poet ivan confessed reluctantly for some reason     the visitor became upset     ah just my luck he exclaimed but at once reconsidered apologizedand asked and what is your name     homeless     ohoh  the guest said wincing     what you mean you dislike my poetry ivan asked with curiosity     i dislike it terribly     and what have you read     ive never read any of your poetry the visitor exclaimed nervously     then how can you say that     well
what of it the guest replied as if i havent read others orelse     maybe theres some miracle very well im ready to take  it  onfaith is your poetry good you tell me yourself     monstrous ivan suddenly spoke boldly and frankly     dont write any more the visitor asked beseechingly     i promise and i swear ivan said solemnly     the  oath  was sealed with a handshake  and  here soft  footsteps  andvoices were heard in the corridor     shh the guest whispered and  jumping out to the balcony closed thegrille behind him     praskovya  fyodorovna  peeked  in asked ivan how he  was  feeling  andwhether he wished  to sleep in the dark or  with a light ivan  asked her toleave the light on and praskovya fyodorovna withdrew wishing the patient agood night and when everything was quiet the guest came back again     he informed ivan in a whisper that  there was a new arrival in room 119 some  fat man with a  purple  physiognomy  who kept muttering  somethingabout  currency in 
the  ventilation and swearing that unclean  powers  wereliving in their place on sadovaya     he curses pushkin up and down and keeps shouting kurolesov  encoreencore the guest said twitching nervously having calmed himself he satdown  said anyway god  help him  and continued  his  conversation withivan so how did you wind up here     on account of pontius  pilate  ivan replied casting  a glum look atthe floor     what  the guest cried forgetting all caution and clapped his handover  his own mouth a staggering coincidence tell me about it i beg youi beg you     feeling  trust  in  the  unknown  man  for  some  reason  ivan  beganfalteringly  and timorously  at first  then more boldly to tell about  theprevious days  story  at the  patriarchs  ponds yes  it  was  a gratefullistener that  ivan  nikolaevich  acquired in the person  of  the mysteriousstealer  of keys the guest did not  take ivan for a madman he showed greatinterest in what  he  was being
told and as  the  story developed finallybecame ecstatic time and again he interrupted ivan with exclamations     well well go on go  on i beg you only  in the name of all thatsholy dont leave anything out     ivan left nothing out in any  case it was easier for  him  to tell  itthat  way  and he  gradually  reached the moment when pontius  pilate in awhite mantle with bloodred lining came out to the balcony     then the visitor put his hands together prayerfully and whispered     oh how i guessed how i guessed it all     the  listener  accompanied the  description of berliozs terrible deathwith an enigmatic remark while his eyes flashed with spite     i only regret  that  it  wasnt  the  critic  latunsky  or the  writermstislav lavrovich instead of this  berlioz and  he cried  out frenziedlybut soundlessly go on     the  cat  handing  money  to  the  woman  conductor  amused  the  guestexceedingly  and he choked with quiet laughter watching as ivan excited bythe  success
of his narration quietly hopped on  bent legs portraying  thecat holding the coin up next to his whiskers     and  so  ivan concluded growing  sad  and melancholy  after tellingabout the events at griboedovs i wound up here     the guest sympathetically placed a hand on the poor poets shoulder andspoke thus     unlucky poet but you yourself  dear heart are to blame for it  allyou oughtnt to have behaved so casually and even impertinently with him soyouve paid  for  it and  you  must still  say thank you  that you got  offcomparatively cheaply     but who is he finally ivan asked shaking his fists in agitation     the guest peered at ivan and answered with a question     youre  not going to get  upset were  all  unreliable here  therewont be any calling for the doctor injections or other fuss     no no ivan exclaimed tell me who is he     very well the visitor replied and he said weightily and distinctly     yesterday at the patriarchs ponds you met
satan     ivan did not get upset as he had  promised but even so he was greatlyastounded     that cant be he doesnt exist     good  heavens anyone  else might say  that  but not  you  you  wereapparently one  of  his  first  victims youre  sitting  as  you  yourselfunderstand in  a psychiatric clinic yet you keep saying  he doesnt existreally its strange     thrown off ivan fell silent     as soon as you started describing him the guest went on i began torealize who it was that you had the pleasure of talking with yesterday andreally im  surprised  at  berlioz  now  you  of course  are a  virginalperson  here  the  guest apologized again but  that  one from what iveheard  about him  had  after all read at least  something the  very  firstthings  this  professor said dispelled  all my  doubts  one cant  fail  torecognize him  my friend though  you   again i  must apologize but imnot mistaken you are an ignorant man     indisputably the unrecognizable
ivan agreed     well so   even  the face as you described it the different eyesthe eyebrows   forgive me however perhaps youve never even heard  theopera faust     ivan became terribly embarrassed for some reason and his face  aflamebegan mumbling something about some trip to a sanatorium  to yalta        well so so  hardly surprising but berlioz i repeat astounds me hes  not only a wellread man but also a very shrewd one though i mustsay in his defence that woland is of course capable  of pulling  the  woolover the eyes of an even shrewder man     what ivan cried out in his turn     hush     ivan slapped himself roundly on the forehead with his palm and rasped     i see i see he had the letter w on his visiting card  aiyaiyaiwhat a thing he lapsed into a bewildered silence for some time peering atthe moon floating  outside the  grille and then  spoke  so that means  hemight actually have been at pontius pilates he was already born 
then andthey call me a madman ivan added indignantly pointing to the door     a bitter wrinkle appeared on the guests lips     lets  look the truth  in  the  eye  and the guest  turned  his facetowards the nocturnal luminary racing through  a cloud  you and i are bothmadmen theres  no denying  that  you see he shocked  you   and you cameunhinged since  you evidently had the ground prepared  for it but what youdescribe undoubtedly  took place in reality but  its so extraordinary thateven stravinsky a psychiatrist of genius did  not of course believe youdid he examine you ivan  nodded your interlocutor was at pilates andhad breakfast with kant and now hes visiting moscow     but hell  be up to devil knows  what  here oughtnt we to catch  himsomehow the  former  not yet  definitively quashed ivan still raised  hishead though without much confidence in the new ivan     youve already tried and  that  will do for you  the  guest repliedironically i dont advise
others  to try  either and as for being  up  tosomething rest  assured  he will be ah ah but how annoying  that it wasyou who met him and not i though  its all  burned up  and  the coals havegone  to  ashes  still  i  swear  for  that meeting  id  give  praskovyafyodorovnas bunch of keys for i have nothing else to give im destitute     but what do you need him for     the  guest paused  ruefully  for a long time and  twitched but finallyspoke     you  see  its  such a  strange story im sitting here  for the samereason  you  are   namely on  account of  pontius pilate here  the guestlooked around fearfully and said the  thing is that  a  year  ago i wrote anovel about pilate     youre a writer the poet asked with interest     the guests face darkened and he threatened  ivan  with his fist  thensaid     i  am a  master  he  grew stern  and  took  from  the pocket  of hisdressinggown a completely greasy black cap with  the letter m embroideredon it in yellow silk
he put this cap on  and showed himself to ivan both inprofile and full face to prove that he was a  master she  sewed it for mewith her own hands he added mysteriously     and what is your name     i no  longer  have  a  name  the strange guest answered  with gloomydisdain  i  renounced  it as i  generally  did everything  in life letsforget it     then at least tell me about the novel ivan asked delicately     if you please  sir my life it must be  said has  taken  a not veryordinary course the guest began       a historian by education he had worked until two years ago at oneof the moscow museums and besides that had also done translations     from what languages ivan interrupted curiously     i know  five languages  besides my own replied the guest  englishfrench german latin and greek well i can also read italian a little     oh my ivan whispered enviously         the historian had lived solitarily  had no family anywhere  andalmost no acquaintances
in moscow and just think one day he won a hundredthousand roubles     imagine my  astonishment the guest in the black cap whispered wheni put my hand in the basket of dirty laundry and lo and  behold it had thesame number as in the newspaper a state bond he explained they gave itto me at the museum        having won a  hundred  thousand roubles ivans mysterious  guestacted thus bought books gave up his room on myasnitskaya       ohh that accursed hole    he growled        and rented from a builder in a lane near the arbat two rooms inthe basement of a little house in the garden he left his work at the museumand began writing a novel about pontius pilate     ah that was a golden age the narrator whispered  his eyes shininga  completely private little  apartment  plus  a front hall with a sink init he underscored for some reason with special pride little windows justlevel  with the paved walk leading  from the gate opposite only four stepsaway near the fence
lilacs a linden and a maple ah ah ah in winter itwas very seldom  that i saw someones black feet through my window and heardthe snow crunching under them and in my stove a fire was eternally blazingbut suddenly spring came and through the dim glass i saw lilac bushes nakedat first  then  dressing  themselves  up  in green  and it was  then lastspring that  something  happened far more delightful than getting a hundredthousand roubles and that you must agree is a huge sum of money     thats true acknowledged the attentively listening ivan i opened mylittle windows and sat in the second quite minuscule room the guest beganmeasuring with his arms heres the sofa and another sofa  opposite and alittle  table  between them  with a  beautiful night lamp on  it and booksnearer the window and here a small writing table and in the  first room a  huge  room one hundred and  fifty square feet   books books and  thestove  ah what furnishings i  had the extraordinary smell of the 
lilacsand my head was getting light with fatigue and pilate was flying to the end       white mantle  red  lining i understand ivan exclaimed  preciselyso pilate  was flying to the end  to the end  and i already knew that thelast words of the novel would be    the fifth procurator  of judea theequestrian pontius pilate well naturally i  used to go out for a walk ahundred thousand is a huge sum and i  had an  excellent suit or id go andhave  dinner  in some cheap restaurant there was a wonderful  restaurant onthe arbat i dont know whether it exists now here the guests eyes openedwde and he  went on  whispering  gazing  at the  moon  she was carryingrepulsive alarming yellow  flowers in her  hand devil knows  what  theyrecalled but for some reason theyre the first to appear in moscow and theseflowers  stood out clearly  against her black spring  coat she was carryingyellow flowers not a nice colour she turned down a lane from tverskaya andthen looked back
well you know tverskaya thousands of people were walkingalong tverskaya but i can assure you that  she saw me alone and looked notreally alarmed but even  as if in pain and i was struck not so much by herbeauty as  by an extraordinary loneliness  in  her eyes  such as no one hadever seen  before obeying this yellow sign i also turned down the lane andfollowed her  we  walked along the  crooked boring lane silendy i  on oneside she on the other  and  imagine there  was not a soul in the lane iwas suffering  because it seemed  to  me that it  was necessary to speak toher and i worried that i wouldnt utter a single word and she would leaveand id never see her again and imagine suddenly she began to speak      do you like my flowers     i remember clearly the sound other voice rather low  slightly huskyand stupid as  it is  it seemed that the echo  resounded  in  the lane andbounced off the dirty yellow wall i quickly crossed to her side and comingup to her answered    
no     she looked at me in surprise and i suddenly  and quite unexpectedlyunderstood that all my life i had loved precisely this woman quite a thingeh of course youll say im mad     i wont say anything ivan exclaimed and added i beg you go on     and the guest continued     yes she looked at  me  in  surprise and  then having  looked askedthus     you generally dont like flowers     it seemed to me there was hostility in her voice i was walking besideher trying to  keep  in step and  to my surprise  did not feel the leastconstraint      no i like flowers but not this kind i said     which then     i like roses     then i regretted having said it because she smiled guiltily and threwthe flowers into the gutter  slightly at a loss i nevertheless picked themup and gave them to her but she with a smile pushed the flowers away andi carried them in my hand     so we  walked silently for some time
until she  took the flowers frommy  hand and threw them to  the pavement then put her own  hand in a  blackglove with a bellshaped cuff under my arm and we walked on side by side     go on said ivan and please dont leave anything out     go on repeated the visitor why you can guess  for yourself how itwent on  he  suddenly wiped  an  unexpected tear with his right sleeve andcontinued love  leaped out  in front  of us like  a murderer in  an  alleyleaping out of nowhere and struck us both at once as lightning strikes asa finnish knife strikes she by the way insisted afterwards that it wasntso that we had of course loved each other  for a long long time withoutknowing  each other never having seen each other and  that she  was livingwith a different man  as i was  too then   with that whats her       with whom asked homeless     with that     well   with    replied the  guest snapping hisfingers     you were married     why  yes  thats  why
im snapping     with that   varenka manechka    no varenka  striped dress the museum  anyhow i dontremember     well so she  said she  went out  that day with yellow flowers  in herhand  so that i would find her at last and that if  it hadnt happened shewould have poisoned herself because her life was empty     yes love struck us instantly i knew it that same day an hour laterwhen  without having noticed  the city  we found  ourselves by the kremlinwall on the embankment     we talked as if we had parted only the  day before as if we  had knowneach other  for many years we arranged to  meet  the  next day  at the sameplace  on  the moscow river and we did the  may sun shone down on us  andsoon very soon this woman became my secret wife     she used to come to  me every afternoon but i would begin waiting forher in the morning  this waiting expressed itself in the  moving around  ofobjects  on the table ten minutes  before i  would sit  down by the littlewindow
and begin to  listen  for the banging of  the decrepit gate  and howcurious before  my meeting with her few people came  to  our  yard  moresimply no  one  came  but now it seemed to me that  the  whole  city cameflocking there     bang goes the  gate bang goes my heart and imagine its inevitablysomebodys  dirty  boots  level  with  my   face   behind   the  window   aknifegrinder now who needs a knifegrinder in our house to sharpen whatwhat knives     she would come through the gate once but my heart would pound no lessthan ten  times before that im not lying and then when her hour came andthe hands showed  noon it even wouldnt stop pounding until almost withouttapping almost noiselessly her shoes would come even with my window theirblack suede bows held tightly by steel buckles     sometimes she would get mischievous pausing at the second window  andtapping the glass with her toe that same instant  i would be at the windowbut the shoe would be gone the  black silk blocking
the light would be gone id go and open the door for her     no  one knew  of  our liaison  i assure you of that though  it neverhappens her husband didnt know her acquaintances  didnt know in the oldhouse where i had that  basement people knew of course they saw that somewoman visited me but they didnt know her name     but  who is she asked ivan intrigued  in the highest degree by thislove story     the  guest made a gesture signifying  that he would never tell that  toanyone and went on with his story     ivan learned that the master and the  unknown woman loved each other sodeeply that they  became  completely inseparable ivan could clearly pictureto himself  the two  rooms in the basement of the house where it was alwaystwilight because  of the lilacs and the fence the  worn  red furniture thebureau the clock on it which struck every half hour and books books fromthe painted floor to the sooty ceiling and the stove     ivan  learned that his  guest and his secret wife from 
the very firstdays  of their  liaison  had  come to the conclusion  that  fate itself hadthrown them together at the corner of tverskaya and that lane and that theyhad been created for each other for all time     ivan learned from the guests story how the lovers would spend the dayshe would come and  put on an  apron first thing  and  in the narrow fronthall  where  stood that  same  sink of which the poor patient  was  for somereason so proud would light the kerosene stove on the wooden table preparelunch and  set it out  on  the oval table in  the first  room when the maystorms   came  and  water  rushed  noisily  through  the  gateway  past  thenearsighted windows threatening to flood  their last  refuge  the  loverswould light the stove and bake potatoes in it steam rose from the potatoesthe  black  potato skins  dirtied  their  fingers  laughter  came from  thebasement  the trees  in  the  garden after rain  shed broken  twigs  whiteclusters     when  the  storms  ended and  sultry summer
came there appeared in thevase  the longawaited roses they both  loved the  man who called himself amaster worked  feverishly  on  his  novel and this novel  also absorbed theunknown woman     really there were times when id begin to be jealous of it on accountof her the night visitor come from the moonlit balcony whispered to ivan     her  slender fingers with  sharply filed nails buried in her  hair sheendlessly reread what he had  written  and  after rereading  it  would  sitsewing that very same cap sometimes she crouched down by  the lower shelvesor stood  by  the upper ones and  wiped  the hundreds of dusty spines with acloth she foretold fame she urged him on and it  was then that she  beganto call him  a master  she waited impatiently for the already promised lastwords about  the fifth procurator ofjudea  repeated aloud  in  a  singsongvoice certain phrases she liked and said that her life was in this novel     it  was finished in  the month  of  august was  given to some  unknowntypist
and she typed it in five copies and finally  the  hour came when hehad to leave his secret refuge and go out into life     and  i went  out  into life holding  it in my hands and then my  lifeended  the master whispered  and  drooped his  head and for  a long  timenodded the woeful black cap with the yellow letter  m on it  he continuedhis story but it became somewhat incoherent one could only understand thatsome catastrophe had then befallen ivans guest     for the first time i found myself in the world of literature but nowwhen  its  all over  and my ruin  is  clear i recall it with horror  themaster  whispered  solemnly and  raised  his  hand  yes  he  astounded megreatly ah how he astounded me     who ivan whispered barely audibly fearing to interrupt the agitatednarrator     why the editor i tell you the editor yes he read it all right helooked at me as if i  had a swollen  cheek looked sidelong into the cornerand even  tittered  in embarrassment he crumpled  the
manuscript needlesslyand grunted the questions he asked seemed crazy to me saving nothing aboutthe essence of the novel he asked me who i was where i came from  and howlong  i  had been writing and why no one  had heard of  me before and evenasked  what in  my opinion was a totally idiotic question who had given  methe  idea  of writing a novel on such a strange theme finally i got sick ofhim and  asked directly whether  he would publish the novel or not here  hestarted squirming mumbled something and  declared that he could not decidethe question  on his own that other members  of the editorial board  had toacquaint themselves  with my work  namely the cridcs latunsky and arimanand the writer  mstislav lavrovich he asked me to come in twoweeks i  came in two  weeks and was  received by  some girl whose eyes werecrossed towards her nose from constant lying     thats lapshennikova the editorial secretary ivan said with a smirkhe knew very well the world described so wrathfully by his
guest     maybe  the other  snapped  and so  from  her i got my novel  backalready quite greasy and dishevelled trying to avoid looking me in the eyelapshennikova told me that the publisher was provided with material for  twoyears ahead and therefore the question of printing my novel as she put itdid not arise     what  do  i remember  after  that the  master muttered  rubbing histemple yes red petals strewn across  the tide page  and also the eyes ofmy friend yes those eyes i remember     the story of ivans guest was becoming more confused more filled  withall  sorts of reticences he said something about  slanting rain and despairin  the basement  refuge  about having  gone  elsewhere he  exclaimed in awhisper that he did not blame her in the  least for pushing him to fight  oh no he did not blame her     further on  as ivan  heard something sudden and strange happened oneday our  hero  opened  a newspaper  and  saw  in it an article by the criticariman in
which  ariman  warned all and sundry that  he thatis our hero had attempted to foist into print an apology for jesus christ     ah i remember i remember ivan cried out  but ive forgotten yourname     lets leave my name out of it i repeat it no longer exists repliedthe guest thats not the point two days  later in another newspaper overthe  signature of mstislav lavrovich appeared another article in which itsauthor recommended striking  and striking hard  at  pilatism  and  at  theicondauber who had  ventured to foist  it  again that accursed word intoprint     dumbfounded by  this  unheardof  word pilatism  i  opened  a thirdnewspaper  there were two articles in it one by latunsky the other signedwith  the  initials  ne i assure you the works  of ariman and lavrovichcould be counted  as jokes compared with what latunsky wrote suffice it  tosay    that   latunskys   article    was   entitled    a   militant    oldbeliever i got so 
carried away  reading  the article  aboutmyself that i didnt notice i had  forgotten to lock the door how she camein and stood before me with a wet umbrella in her hand and wet newspapers aswell her eyes flashed fire her trembling hands were cold first she rushedto kiss me then in a  hoarse voice and  pounding the table with her fistshe said she would poison latunsky     ivan grunted somewhat embarrassedly but said nothing     joyless autumn days set in the guest went on the monstrous failurewith  this  novel  seemed to have  taken out a part  of my soul essentiallyspeaking i had nothing more to do and i lived from one meeting with her tothe next and it was at that time that something happened to me devil knowswhat stravinsky probably figured it out long ago namely anguish came overme and certain forebodings appeared     the articles please  note did  not cease i laughed  at the first ofthem but the more of them that appeared  the more my attitude towards themchanged  the
second  stage was one of astonishment some  rare falsity  andinsecurity  could  be  sensed  literally in every line  of  these  articlesdespite  their threatening  and confident  tone  i had  the feeling  and icouldnt get rid of it that the authors of  these articles were not  sayingwhat they wanted to say and that their rage sprang precisely from that andthen imagine a third stage came  of fear no not fear of these articlesyou understand but fear of other things totally unrelated to them or to thenovel thus for instance i began to  be afraid of  the dark in short thestage of  mental illness came it seemed to  me especially as i was fallingasleep  that  some  very  cold  and  pliant  octopus was stealing with  itstentacles immediately and directly towards my heart and i had to sleep withthe light on     my beloved changed  very much of course i  never told  her about theoctopus  but she  could see that  something was  going wrong with  me shebecame thinner and paler stopped laughing
and kept asking  me  to  forgiveher for  having advised  me to publish  an excerpt  she said  i should dropeverything and go  to the south  to the  black sea  and spend all that wasleft of the hundred thousand on the trip     she was very insistent and to avoid  an argument something told me iwas not to go to the black sea  i promised her that id do it one of thosedays but she said she would buy me  the ticket herself then i took out allmy money  that is about ten thousand roubles  and gave it to her      why so much she was surprised     i said something or  other about being afraid of thieves and asked herto keep the money until my  departure  she  took it put  it in her  pursebegan kissing  me and saying that it would  be easier for her to die than toleave me alone in such a state but that she was expected that she must bowto necessity  that she  would come the  next day she begged  me  not to beafraid of anything     this was at dusk in midoctober and she left i
lay down on die sofaand  fell asleep without turning on the light i was awakened by die feelingdiat the octopus was there groping in the dark i barely managed to turn onthe light my pocket watch showed  two oclock in the morning i was fallingill  when i went to bed and i woke up  sick  it suddenly seemed to me thatthe autumn darkness would push through the glass and pour into the room andi  would  drown in it  as in  ink i got  up a  man  no longer in control ofhimself  i cried out the thought came to me of running to someone even ifit was  my landlord upstairs i  struggled widi myself like a  madman i hadstrength enough to get to  the stove and start a fire  in it  when die woodbegan to  crackle and  the  stove door  rattled i seemed  to  feel  slighdybetter i dashed to the front room turned on die light diere found a botdeof white wine uncorked it and began drinking from the  botde  this bluntedthe fear somewhat  at  least enough to keep me from running to me landlord and  i  went back
to me stove i opened the little door so that the heatbegan to burn my face and hands and whispered      guess that trouble has befallen me    come come come     but no  one  came the fire  roared  in the  stove rain lashed at diewindows then the final thing happened i took the  heavy manuscript  of thenovel and the draft notebooks from the desk drawer and started burning themthis was terribly  hard to do  because writtenon paper  burns  reluctandybreaking  my fingernails i  tore  up the notebooks stuck  them  verticallybetween the logs and ruffled the pages  with the  poker at times the ashesgot die best of me choking the flames but i  struggled with them and  thenovel  though stubbornly  resisting  was nevertheless  perishing familiarwords flashed before  me  the yellow climbed steadily up the pages but thewords  still showed dirough it they would vanish only when die paper turnedblack and i finished diem off with die poker     just  dien  someone  began  scratching
quiedy at the window  my heartleaped and having stuffed the last notebook into the fire i rushed to openthe door brick  steps led up  from  die  basement to  the door on the yardstumbling i ran up to it and asked quiedy      whos there     and that voice her voice answered     its me     i dont remember how i managed with the chain and hook as soon as shestepped inside she clung to me trembling all wet her cheeks  wet and herhair uncurled i could only utter the word      you    you    and my voice broke and we ran downstairs     she  freed herself of her overcoat in  the front hall  and we quicklywent into  the first room with a soft cry she pulled out of the stove withher bare hands and threw on to the floor the last of what was there a sheafthat had caught fire from  below smoke filled  the room at once  i stampedout  the  fire with  my  feet  and  she  collapsed  on  the  sofa and  weptirrepressibly and convulsively     when she calmed
down i said      i came to hate this novel and im afraid im ill frightened     she stood up and said      god how sick  you are why is it why but ill save you  111 saveyou what is all this     i  saw  her eyes swollen widi  smoke and weeping felt her  cold handsstroke my forehead     ill  cure you  ill cure  you she  was  murmuring  clutching  myshoulders youll restore it why why didnt i keep a copy     she bared her teeth with rage she said something else inarticulatelythen  compressing  her  lips  she  began to  collect  and  smoodi  out theburntedged pages it was some chapter from die middle of the novel i dontremember which  she  neady stacked die  pages wrapped them in  paper tiedthem   with  a  ribbon  all  her  actions  showed  that  she  was  full  ofdetermination and diat she had regained  control of herself she asked  forwine and having drunk it spoke more calmly      this is  how one pays for lying
she said and i dont want to lieany more id stay with you right now  but id radier not do it diat way idont want it to  remain for  ever in his memory diat i ran away from him inthe middle of  the night hes never done me any  wrong  he  was summonedunexpectedly there was a fire at the factory     but hell  be back soon ill talk with him tomorrow morning ill tellhim that i love  another  man and  come back to you for ever  or maybe  youdont want that answer me       poor dear my poor dear i  said to her i wont allow you  to doit things wont go well for me and i dont want you to perish with me       is that the only reason  she  asked and brought her eyes dose tomine     the only one     she became  terribly animated she dung to me put her arms  around myneck and said      im perishing with you in the morning ill be here     and so  the last thing  i remember  from  my life is a strip of lightfrom
my front  hall and in that strip of light an uncurled strand  of hairher beret  and her eyes filled with determination i also remember the blacksilhouette in the outside doorway and the white package      id  see you home but its beyond my strength  to come  back aloneim afraid      dont be afraid bear with it for a few hours tomorrow morning illbe here     those  were  her  last words  in my life    shh   the  patientsuddenly interrupted himself  and raised a  finger its a restless moonlitnight tonight     he disappeared on to  the balcony ivan heard little  wheels roll  downthe corridor someone sobbed or cried out weakly     when everything grew still the guest came back and announced that room120 had received  an occupant someone had been brought  and he kept askingto be given back his head the two interlocutors fell anxiously silent buthaving  calmed down they returned to the interrupted story the  guest  wasjust opening his  mouth but the night
was indeed a restless one there werestill voices in the corridor and the guest began to speak into ivans  earso softly that what he told  him  was known only to the poet apart from thefirst phrase     a quarter of an hour  after  she  left me there came  a knock  at  mywindow       what the patient whispered into ivans  ear evidently agitated him verymuch spasms repeatedly passed over his face fear and rage swam and flittedin his eyes the narrator pointed his hand somewhere in the direction of themoon which  had long  since left  the  balcony  only when  all sounds fromoutside ceased to reach them did the guest move away from ivan and  begin tospeak more loudly     yes and so in  midjanuary  at night in the same coat but with  thebuttons torn off i was huddled with cold in  my  little yardbehind me were snowdrifts that hid the lilac bushes and before me and below  my little windows  dimly lit covered  with  shades i bent  down to thefirst  of them and listened  a gramophone was
playing in my rooms that wasall i heard but i could not see anything i stood  there a while then wentout  the gate to the lane a blizzard  was frolicking in it a dog  dashingunder my feet frightened me and i ran  away from it to the other side thecold and the fear that had become my constant companion were driving me tofrenzy i had nowhere to go and the simplest thing of course  would  havebeen to throw myself under a  tramcar on the street where my lane came outfrom far off  i could see  those lightfilled icecovered  boxes  and  heartheir loathsome screeching in the frost  but my  dear neighbour the wholething was that  fear  possessed  every cell of  my body and  just as i wasafraid of the dog so i was afraid of the tramcar yes there is no illnessin this place worse than mine i assure you     but  you could have let  her  know said ivan sympathizing  with thepoor patient besides she has your money she did keep it of course     you neednt doubt that of course she
kept it but you evidently dontunderstand me or rather ive lost the  ability i once  had for describingthings  however im not  very sorry about that since i no longer have anyuse for it before her the guest reverently looked  out at the darkness ofthe  night there  would  lie a letter from a  madhouse how  can  one sendletters from such  an address  a mental  patient   youre  joking myfriend make her unhappy no im not capable of that     ivan was unable to object to this but the silent ivan sympathized withthe guest  he commiserated with him  and  the other from  the pain of hismemories nodded his head in the black cap and spoke thus     poor woman   however i have hopes that she has forgotten me       but you may recover  ivan said timidly     i am incurable the guest replied  calmly  when stravinsky says  hewill bring me  back to life i dont believe  him he is  humane  and simplywants to comfort me  i dont deny however that im  much better now yesso
where did i leave  off frost  those flying trams   i knew that  thisclinic had been opened and set  out for it on foot across the entire  citymadness outside  the city i probably would have frozen to death but chancesaved me  a truck had broken down  i came  up to the  driver it was  somethree miles beyond the city limits and to my surprise he  took pity  on methe truck was coming here and he took me  along i got away with having  myleft toes frostbitten but they cured that and now this is the fourth monththat ive been here and  you know  i find  it not at  all  bad here  onemustnt make  grandiose plans  dear neighbour  really  i  for  instancewanted to go all around the globe well so it turns out that im not  goingto do it i see  only an insignificant piece of that  globe  i suppose itsnot the very best there is on it but i repeat its not  so bad summer iscoming  the  ivy will  twine up on to the  balcony so praskovya fyodorovnapromises the keys have broadened my  possibilities
therell be the moon atnight ah its gone freshness its falling past midnight time to go     tell me what happened afterwards with  yeshua and pilate ivan askedi beg you i want to know     ah no no the guest replied with a painful twitch i cannot recallmy novel without trembling and your acquaintance from the patriarchs pondswould do it better than i thank you for the conversation goodbye     and  before ivan  could collect his  senses the grille  closed  with aquiet clang and the guest vanished

chapter 14 glory to the cock       his nerves gave out as they say and rimsky fled to his office  beforethey finished drawing  up the report  he sat  at his  desk and  stared withinflamed eyes at  the magic banknotes  lying before  him the  findirectorswits were addled a steady  hum came  from  outside the  audience poured instreams  from  the  variety building  into  the  street  rimskys extremelysharpened hearing  suddenly caught the distant trill of a policeman that initself  never  bodes anything pleasant but  when it  was  repeated and  toassist  it another joined in more authoritative and prolonged and to themwas added a clearly audible guffawing and even some hooting the findirectorunderstood at once that  something else scandalous  and vile had happened inthe street and that however much he wanted to wave it away it was closelyconnected with  the repulsive seance presented by the black magician and hisassistants     the keeneared findirector was not mistaken in the least as soon as hecast a  glance 
out the window on to sadovaya his face  twisted and he didnot whisper but hissed     so i thought     in  the bright glare of the  strongest street lights he saw just belowhim on  the sidewalk a  lady in nothing  but  a  shift and violet bloomerstrue there  was a little hat on  the ladys head  and  an  umbrella  in herhands the lady  who was in a state  of utter consternation  now crouchingdown now making as if  to run off somewhere was surrounded by an  agitatedcrowd which produced the very guffawing that  had  sent a  shiver down  thefindirectors  spine next  to  the lady  some  citizen was flitting abouttrying  to tear off his summer coat and in his agitation simply  unable tomanage the sleeve in which his arm was stuck     shouts and roaring guffaws came from yet another  place   namely theleft entrance  and turning his head in that  direction  grigory danilovichsaw a  second lady  in pink underwear  she  leaped from the street to  thesidewalk  striving  to  hide in  the hallway 
but the audience pouring outblocked the way  and the poor victim  other own flightiness and passion fordressing up deceived by vile  fagotts firm  dreamed of only one thing  falling  through  the earth a  policeman  made for  the  unfortunate womandrilling the  air with his  whisde  and  after the policeman hastened  somemerry young men in caps it was they who produced the guffawing and hoodng     a skinny moustachioed  cabby flew  up to the first undressed woman anddashingly  reined  in his  bony brokendown nag  the  moustached face  wasgrinning gleefully     rimsky  beat  himself on the  head with his fist spat and leaped backfrom the  window for some time he sat at his desk listening to the  streetthe whistling  at  various points reached its highest  pitch then  began tosubside  the scandal  to rimskys  surprise  was somehow liquidated  withunexpected swiftness     it came time to act he had to drink  the bitter cup of responsibilitythe telephones  had been repaired  during  the
third  part he had  to  makecalls to tell what had happened to  ask for  help lie his  way out of itheap everything  on  likhodeev  cover up for himself and so  on pah  thedevil     twice the upset director  put  his  hand  on the receiver and twice hedrew it back and suddenly in the dead silence of the office the telephoneburst out ringing by itself right in  the findirectors face and he  gave astart and went cold my nerves are really upset though  he  thought andpicked up the receiver he recoiled from it instantly and turned whiter thanpaper  a  soft  but  at  the same time insinuating  and  lewd female  voicewhispered into the receiver     dont call anywhere rimsky itll be bad       the  receiver straight away went  empty with gooseflesh prickling  onhis back the findirector hung up  the telephone and  for some reason turnedto look  at the  window  behind  him  through the scant  and  still  barelygreening branches of a maple he saw the moon racing in a transparent cloudhis 
eyes fixed  on the  branches for some reason rimsky went  on gazing atthem and the longer he gazed the more strongly he was gripped by fear     with great effort the findirector finally turned away from the moonlitwindow  and stood up there could no  longer be any question of phone callsand now the findirector was thinking of only one thing  getting out of thetheatre as quickly as possible     he listened the theatre building  was  silent rimsky realized that hehad  long  been  the  only one on  the whole second  floor and a  childishirrepressible fear came over him at this thought he could not think withoutshuddering  of having to  walk alone now along  the empty corridors and downthe stairs  feverishly  he seized the hypnotists banknotes from the tableput them in his briefcase and coughed so as to cheer himself  up at least alittle the cough came out slightly hoarse weak     and here it  seemed  to  him that  a whiff of  some putrid dankness wascoming in  under the office  door shivers
ran down the findirectors spineand  then the clock also rang out unexpectedly and began to strike midnightand  even  its striking provoked  shivers  in the findirector but his heartdefinitively sank when he heard the english  key turning quiedy in the lockclutching his briefcase  with damp cold hands the findirector felt that ifthis  scraping in the keyhole were to  go on any longer he would break downand give a piercing scream     finally the door  yielded to someones efforts opened  and  varenukhanoiselessly  entered the  office rimsky simply sank down into  the armchairwhere he stood because his legs gave  way drawing a deep breath he smiledan ingratiating smile as it were and said quiedy     god you frightened me        yes this sudden appearance might have frightened anyone  you like andyet at the same time it was a great joy at least one little  end peeped outin this tangled affair     well  tell me quickly well well rimsky wheezed  grasping  at thislittle end what does
it all mean     excuse  me  please  the  entering man replied  in a  hollow  voiceclosing the door i thought you had already left     and varenukha  without taking  his cap off walked to the armchair andsat on the other side of the desk     it must be said that varenukhas response was marked by a slight odditywhich at once needled the findirector who could compete in sensitivity withthe seismograph of any  of the worlds best stations  how could it be wlwdid varenukha come to  the findirectors office if he  thought  he  was  notthere  he had his own office first of all and  second whichever entranceto the building varenukha had used he would inevitably  have met one of thenightwatchmen to all of whom it had been announced that grigory danilovichwas staying  late in  his office but  the findirector  did  not spend  longpondering this oddity  he had other problems     why didnt you call what are all these shenanigans about yalta     well its as i was saying the administrator 
replied sucking as ifhe were troubled by a bad tooth he was found in the tavern in pushkino     in  pushkino you mean just outside moscow what about the telegramsfrom yalta     the devil theyre from yalta he got a telegrapher drunk in  pushkinoand  the two  of them  started acting up sending  telegrams marked yaltaamong other things     aha  aha  well all right all right  rimsky did not say butsang out  his eyes lit up with a yellow light in his head there formed thefestive picture  of styopas shameful  dismissal  from his job deliverancethe findirectors longawaited deliverance from this  disaster in the personof likhodeev  and  maybe stepan  bogdanovich would achieve something  worsethan dismissal    the details said rimsky  banging the paperweight  onthe desk     and varenukha began giving the details as soon as he arrived where thefindirector had sent him he was received at once and given a most attentivehearing  no one of course even entertained
the  thought that styopa couldbe  in  yalta everyone agreed  at once  with  varenukhas  suggestion  thatlikhodeev was of course at the yalta in pushkino     then  where  is he now  the  agitated  findirector  interrupted  theadministrator     well  where else  could he  be the administrator  replied grinningcrookedly in a soberingup cell naturally     well well how nice     varenukha  went on  with  his story and  the  more he  told the  morevividly  there unfolded before the findirector the long chain of likhodeevsboorish and outrageous acts and every link in this chain was worse than theone before the  drunken dancing  in the arms of the telegrapher on the lawnin front of  the pushkino telegraph office to the sounds of  some  itinerantbarrelorgan  was  worth  something  the  chase after some female  citizensshrieking with terror the attempt at a fight with the  barman in the  yaltaitself scattering  green  onions  all  over the  floor of  the  same yaltasmashing  eight  bottles
of dry white  aidanil breaking the meter when thetaxidriver  refused to  take styopa in his  cab threatening to  arrest thecitizens who attempted to stop  styopas obnoxiousness   in short  blackhorror     styopa was well known in moscow theatre circles and everyone knew thatthe man was  no gift  but all the  same what the administrator was tellingabout  him was too much even for styopa yes too much even much too much      rimskys  needlesharp  glance  pierced  the administrators  face fromacross  the desk and  the  longer the  man spoke  the grimmer  those  eyesbecame the  more lifelike  and  colourful  the  vile details with which theadministrator  furnished his story the  less the  findirector  believed thestoryteller and when varenukha told how styopa had let himself go so far asto try to resist those who came to bring him back to moscow the findirectoralready knew  firmly that everything the  administrator  who had returned atmidnight was telling him everything was a  lie a lie
from first  word  tolast     varenukha never went to  pushkino and there was no styopa in pushkinothere was no drunken telegrapher there  was no broken  glass in the tavernstyopa did not get tied up with ropes  none of it happened     as  soon   as  the  findirector  became   firmly   convinced  that  theadministrator was lying to him fear crept over his body starting from  thelegs  and  twice  again the  findirector fancied  that  a  putrid  malarialdankness was  wafting  across the  floor never for a moment taking his eyesoff the administrator   who squirmed somehow  strangely  in  his armchairtrying not to  get out  of the blue shade of the  desk  lamp and  screeninghimself with a newspaper  in  some  remarkable  fashion from the  bothersomelight  the findirector was thinking  of only one thing  what did  it  allmean why was he  being lied  to  so brazenly  in  the silent and  desertedbuilding  by  the administrator who was so late in  coming back to him andthe awareness of danger  an
unknown but  menacing danger began  to gnaw atrimskys soul  pretending to ignore varenukhas dodges and tricks with  thenewspaper the findirector studied his face now almost without listening tothe yarn varenukha was spinning there  was something that seemed still moreinexplicable  than the calumny invented  god knows why about adventures inpushkino  and  that   something  was  the  change  in  the  administratorsappearance and manners     no matter how the  man pulled  the ducklike visor of his cap over  hiseyes  so as to throw a shadow on his  face no matter how he fidgeted  withthe newspaper the findirector managed to make out an enormous bruise on theright  side  of  his  face  just  by the  nose  besides that the  normallyfullblooded administrator was now pale with a chalklike unhealthy pallorand on  this stifling night  his neck was for  some reason wrapped in an oldstriped  scarf  add  to that  the repulsive manner  the  administrator  hadacquired during the rime of his  absence of 
sucking and smacking the sharpchange in his voice which had become hollow and coarse and the furtivenessand cowardliness in his eyes and one could boldly say that ivan savelyevichvarenukha had become unrecognizable     something else burningly troubled the findirector but he was unable tograsp precisely what it  was however much  he strained  his feverish  mindhowever hard he peered at varenukha one thing he  could affirm that  therewas  something   unprecedented  unnatural  in   this  combination  of   theadministrator and the familiar armchair     well we finally overpowered him loaded him into the car  varenukhaboomed peeking from behind the paper and covering the bruise with his hand     rimsky suddenly  reached  out and  as  if  mechanically  tapping  hisfingers on the table at the same time pushed  the electricbell button withhis palm and went numb  the sharp signal ought to have been  heard  withoutfail  in  the  empty  building  but no signal came  and  the  button  sanklifelessly
into the wood of the desk the button was dead the bell broken     the findirectors stratagem did not escape the notice of varenukha whoasked twitching with a clearly malicious fire flickering in his eyes     what are you ringing for     mechanically the  findirector  replied  hollowly  jerking  his handback and asked in turn in an unsteady voice whats that on your face     the car skidded  i bumped  against the doorhandle varenukha  saidlooking away     hes lying  the findirector  exclaimed mentally  and here  his eyessuddenly  grew round and utterly insane and he stared  at  the back of  thearmchair     behind the chair  on the floor two shadows  lay  crisscross one  moredense and  black the  other faint and grey the  shadow of the back  of thechair and  of its tapering legs  could be seen distinctly on the floor  butthere was  no shadow of varenukhas head  above the back of the chair or ofthe administrators legs under its legs     he  casts no shadow 
rimsky  cried out  desperately in his mind  hebroke into shivers     varenukha  following rimskys insane gaze looked furtively behind himat the back of the chair and realized that he had been found out     he got  up from the  chair the findirector  did likewise and made onestep back from the desk clutching his briefcase in his hands     hes guessed damn him always was  clever varenukha said  grinningspitefully right in the findirectors face and he sprang unexpectedly  fromthe  chair to  the door  and quickly pushed down  the catch on the lock thefindirector  looked desperately behind  him  as  he retreated to the windowgiving on to the garden and in this window flooded with moonlight saw theface of a naked  girl pressed against the  glass and her naked arm  reachingthrough the ventpane and trying  to open the lower latch the upper one wasalready open     it seemed  to rimsky that the light of  the desk lamp was going out andthe desk was tilting an icy wave engulfed rimsky but  fortunately
for him he got control of himself and did  not  fall he had enough strength leftto whisper but not cry out     help       varenukha guarding the door  hopped up and down by it staying in airfor  a long  rime and swaying there  waving his hooked  fingers in rimskysdirection he hissed and smacked winking to the girl in the window     she began to hurry stuck her redhaired head through the vent reachedher arm  down as far as she could her nails clawing at  the lower latch andshaking  the  frame  her  arm began  to  lengthen  rubberlike and becamecovered with a putrid green finally the dead womans green fingers got holdof the latch knob turned  it and the frame began to open rimsky cried outweakly leaned against the wall and held his briefcase in front of him likea shield he realized that his end had come     the frame swung wide open but instead of the nights freshness and thefragrance of the  lindens the smell  of  a cellar burst into the room  thedead woman  stepped on to the
windowsill rimsky clearly saw spots of decayon her breast     and just then the joyful unexpected crowing of  a cock  came  from thegarden  from  that  low building  beyond the shooting  gallery  where birdsparticipating in  the  programme were kept a  loud trained cock trumpetedannouncing that dawn was rolling towards moscow from the east     savage fury distorted the girls face  she emitted a hoarse oath  andat the door varenukha shrieked and dropped from the air to the floor     the  cockcrow  was repeated the girl  clacked  her teeth and her redhair stood on end  with  the third crowing of the cock she turned and flewout  and  after her jumping up and  stretching himself horizontally in  theair looking like a flying cupid varenukha slowly floated over the desk andout the window     white  as snow  with not a single black hair on his head the old  manwho still recently  had been  rimsky  rushed to  the door  undid the catchopened the door and ran hurtling down the dark corridor at
the turn to thestairs moaning with fear he felt for the switch and the stairway  lightedup on the stairs the shaking trembling old  man  fell because  he imaginedthat varenukha had softly tumbled on top of him     having  run downstairs  rimsky saw a watchman asleep on a chair by thebox office in the lobby rimsky stole past him on tiptoe and   slipped  outthe main entrance outside he felt slighdy better he  recovered his  sensesenough to realize clutching his head that his hat had stayed behind in theoffice     needless to say he did not go back for it but breathless ran acrossthe wide street to  the opposite corner  by the movie theatre near which  adull  reddish light hovered in a  moment he was there  no one had time  tointercept the cab     make  the leningrad express ill tip you  well the  old  man  saidbreathing heavily and clutching his heart     im going to  the  garage the driver  answered hatefully  and turnedaway     then rimsky unlatched his briefcase took out fifty
roubles and handedthem to the driver through the open front window     a few moments  later  the rattling car  was flying  like the wind downsadovoye ring  the passenger  was  tossed about  on  his seat and  in  thefragment of mirror  hanging  in front  of  the driver  rimsky saw  now  thedrivers happy eyes now his own insane ones     jumping out of the car in front  of the train station rimsky cried  tothe first man he saw in a white apron with a badge     first class single ill pay  thirty he  was pulling  the banknotesfrom  his briefcase crumpling  them no first  class get me second  ifnot  a hard bench     the man with the badge kept glancing up at the lighted clock face as hetore the banknotes from rimskys hand     five  minutes later the express train disappeared from under  the glassvault of the train station and vanished clean away in the darkness and withit vanished rimsky

theatre  there was a  stage closed off by a velvet curtain itsdark cerise  background spangled  as  if  with  stars with  oversized goldpieces there was a prompters box and there was even an audience     what surprised nikanor ivanovich was that  this audience was all of thesame sex   male  and all  for some reason bearded  besides  that it  wasstriking  that  there were no seats in the theatre and the audience was allsitting on the floor splendidly polished and slippery     abashed in this new and big  company nikanor ivanovich  after a briefhesitation  followed  the  general  example  and  sat down  on the  parquetturkishfashion huddled  between some stalwart bearded redhead and anothercitizen pale and quite overgrown none of the sitters paid any attention tothe newly arrived spectator     here the soft ringing of a bell was heard the lights in the house wentout and the  curtain opened to reveal a lighted  stage  with an armchair alittle  table  on  which stood  a  golden bell  and 
a solid  black  velvetbackdrop     an  artiste came  out  from the  wings in an  evening  jacket smoothlyshaven  his hair neatly parted young and with  very pleasant features theaudience in the house livened up and everyone turned towards the stage theartiste advanced to the prompters box and rubbed his hands     all sitting he asked in a soft baritone and smiled  tothe house sitting  sitting a chorus of tenors and  basses answered fromthe house     hm    the artiste began pensively and how youre not sick of iti just dont understand everybody else is out walking around  now enjoyingthe spring sun  and the  warmth and youre stuck in here on  the floor of astuffy theatre is  the programme so interesting  tastes  differ howeverthe artiste concluded philosophically     then he  changed both the  timbre of  his voice and its intonation andannounced gaily and resoundingly     and  now for  the next number  on our  programme  nikanor  ivanovichbosoy chairman of a  house committee
and  director of  a dietetic  kitchennikanor ivanovich onstage     general  applause greeted  the artiste the surprised nikanor ivanovichgoggled his eyes while the master of ceremonies  blocking the glare of thefootlights  with  his  hand  located him  among  the  sitters and  tenderlybeckoned  him  onstage  with  his  finger  and nikanor  ivanovich withoutknowing how found himself onstage beams of coloured light struck his eyesfrom in front and below which at once caused the house and the  audience tosink into darkness     well  nikanor  ivanovich set  us  a  good example  sir the  youngartiste said soulfully turn over your currency     silence ensued  nikanor ivanovich took  a deep breath and quiedy beganto speak     i swear to god that i     but before he had time to get the words out the whole house burst intoshouts of indignation nikanor ivanovich got confused and fell silent     as far as i understand you said the programme announcer you wantedto  swear  to  god

these treasures   priceless vet  useless in the  hands  of  aprivate person many thanks ida herkulanovna     the  beauty  smiled  flashing  her  teeth   and  her  lush  eyelashesfluttered and under your so very dignified  mask the artiste adverted todunchil is  concealed  a  greedy spider and an astonishing  bamboozler andliar you wore everyone out during  this month  and a half  with  your  dullobstinacy go home now and let the hell your  wife  sets up for you be yourpunishment     dunchil  swayed and it seems wanted to fall  down but was held up bysomeones sympathetic  hands here the  front  curtain dropped and concealedall those onstage     furious applause shook the  house so  much so  that nikanor ivanovichfancied  the lights  were  leaping in the chandelers when the front curtainwent up  there was  no one onstage except the lone artiste greeted with asecond burst of applause he bowed and began to speak     in the person  of this dunchil our programme has shown you  a typicalass 
i  did have the pleasure  of saying  yesterday that  the concealing ofcurrency is senseless no one  can make use of it under any circumstances iassure  you  lets  take this same dunchil he gets a  splendid salary  anddoesnt  want  for  anything  he  has  a  splendid apartment a wife and  abeautiful mistress but no instead of living quietly and peacefully withoutany troubles having turned over  the  currency  and stones this  mercenaryblockhead gets  himself  exposed in front of everybody  and  to top  it offcontracts  major  family  trouble  so  whos  going  to  turn  over   anyvolunteers  in that case  for the  next number on our programme  a famousdramatic  talent the actor  kurolesov sawa  potapovich especially invitedhere will perform excerpts from the covetous knight by the poet pushkin     the promised kurolesov  was not  slow in coming on stage and turned outto be a strapping and beefy man cleanshaven  in a tailcoat and white tiewithout any  preliminaries he concocted a gloomy 
face knitted  his browsand began speaking in an  unnatural voice glancing  sidelong at  the goldenbell     as  a  young scapegrace  awaits  a  tryst  with  some  sly  strumpet     and kurolesov  told many  bad things about  himself nikanor ivanovichheard kurolesov  confess  that some wretched widow had gone on  her knees tohim howling in the rain but had failed to move the actors callous heart     before his dream nikanor ivanovich had been completely ignorant of thepoet pushkins works but the man himself he knew perfectly well and severaltimes a  day used to say phrases like and whos  going to pay  the rent  pushkin or then who did unscrew the bulb  on the stairway pushkin or so whos going to buy the fuel  pushkin     now  having become acquainted with one of his works nikanor ivanovichfelt  sad  imagined the  woman on her knees with her orphaned children inthe rain and involuntarily thought what a type though this kurolesov     and the latter ever raising
his voice went on with his confession andgot  nikanor  ivanovich definitively muddled  because he  suddenly  startedaddressing someone  who was  not onstage and responded for this absent onehimself calling himself now  dear sir  now baron now father now son nowformally and now familiarly     nikanor  ivanovich understood only one thing  that  the actor died  anevil death crying out  keys my keys after  which  he collapsed on thefloor gasping and carefully tearing off his tie     having  died  kurolesov got  up  brushed  the dust from his trousersbowed  with  a  false  smile  and  withdrew  to  the accompaniment of  thinapplause and the master of ceremonies began speaking thus     we have just  heard  the covetous knight wonderfully performed by sawapotapovich this  knight  hoped that frolicking nymphs would come running tohim and that many other pleasant things in the same vein would  occur butas you  see  none of  it happened no nymphs  came running to him  and themuses paid 
him no tribute and he raised no mansions but on the contraryended  quite badly died of  a  stroke  devil  take  him on  his chest  ofcurrency and jewels i warn  you that the same sort of  thing if not worseis going to happen to you if you dont turn over your currency     whether pushkins poetry produced such an effect or it was the prosaicspeech of the master  of ceremonies in any case a shy  voice  suddenly camefrom the house     ill turn over my currency     kindly  come to the  stage  the  master  of  ceremonies  courteouslyinvited peering into the dark house     onstage appeared a short  fairhaired  citizen who judging  by  hisface had not shaved in about three weeks     beg pardon what is your name the master of ceremonies inquired     kanavkin nikolai the man responded shyly     ah very pleased citizen kanavkin and so      ill turn it over kanavkin said quiedy     how much     a thousand dollars and twenty tenrouble gold pieces     bravo thats
all then     the programme announcer stared straight into  kanavkins  eyes  and iteven  seemed  to nikanor  ivanovich  that  those  eyes  sent  out rays  thatpenetrated kanavkin like xrays the house stopped breathing     i  believe  you the artiste  exclaimed finally and extinguished  hisgaze i  do these eyes are not  lying how many times  have i told you thatyour basic error  consists in underestimating the significance of the  humaneye understand  that  the tongue can  conceal  the  truth but  the eyes never a sudden question is put to you you dont even flinch in one secondyou get  hold of yourself and know  what  you must say to conceal the truthand you speak quite convincingly and not a wrinkle on your face moves  but alas   the  truth which the question  stirs up  from the bottom of yoursoul leaps momentarily into your eyes and  its  all over they see it andyoure caught     having delivered and with great ardour this highly convincing speechthe artiste tenderly inquired
of kanavkin     and where is it hidden     with my aunt porokhovnikova on prechistenka     ah thats  wait   thats klavdia ilyinishna isnt it     yes     ah yes yes yes yes a separate little house a little front gardenopposite of course i know i know and where did you put it there     in the cellar in a candy tin       the artiste clasped his hands     have you ever seen the like he cried out chagrined why itll getdamp and mouldy there is it conceivable to entrust currency to such peopleeh sheer childishness by god      kanavkin himself  realized he had fouled up and  was  in for it and hehung his tufty head     money the  artiste went  on must be  kept in the  state  bank  inspecial dry and  wellguarded rooms and  by no means in some aunts cellarwhere it may in particular suffer damage from  rats really kanavkin forshame youre a grownup     kanavkin no longer knew what to do  with himself and  merely picked atthe lapel of
his jacket with his finger     well  all  right the artiste relented  let bygones be  and hesuddenly added  unexpectedly ah by the way  so that in one  to savea trip  this same aunt also has some eh     kanavkin  never  expecting  such a turn of affairs  wavered and  thetheatre fell silent     ehh kanavkin the  master of ceremonies said in  tender  reproachand here i was praising him look  he just went  and  messed it up  for noreason  at all  its  absurd kanavkin  wasnt  i just talking about eyescant we see that the aunt has got some  well then  why  do you torment usfor nothing     she has kanavkin cried dashingly     bravo cried the master of ceremonies     bravo the house roared frightfully     when  things  quieted  down  the  master  of  ceremonies congratulatedkanavkin shook his hand  offered him a ride home to the city in a car andtold someone in the  wings to go in  that same car to fetch the aunt and askher kindly to come for the programme
at the womens theatre     ah  yes i wanted to ask you  has  the aunt ever mentioned where shehides  hers  the  master  of  ceremonies  inquired  courteously  offeringkanavkin a  cigarette  and a lighted match as  he  lit up  the man grinnedsomehow wistfully     i believe you i believe you the artiste responded with a sigh notjust  her nephew  the old pinchfist wouldnt tell the  devil himself wellso well  try  to  awaken some human feelings  in  her  maybe not all  thestrings have rotted in her usurious little soul byebye kanavkin     and  the  happy kanavkin drove off the artiste inquired  whether therewere  any others  who wished to turn over their  currency  but was answeredwith silence     odd birds by god the artiste said  shrugging and the  curtain hidhim     the lights went out  there  was  darkness  for  a  while and  in it anervous tenor was heard singing from far away     there great heaps of  gold do shine and all those  heaps  of  gold aremine     
then twice the sound of subdued applause came from somewhere     some little lady in the womens theatre is turning hers over nikanorivanovichs  redbearded neighbour  spoke up unexpectedly  and added with asigh  ah  if it  wasnt  for my geese    ive  got fighting  geese inlianozovo  my dear  fellow     theyll  die without  me  im afraid  afighting birds delicate it needs care  ah if it wasnt for my geese       they wont surprise  me with  pushkin and again he  began  tosigh     here the  house  lit  up brightly and  nikanor ivanovich  dreamed thatcooks in white  chefs hats and with ladles in their hands came pouring fromall the doors scullions  dragged  in a cauldron of  soup  and a  stand withcutup rye bread the spectators livened up  the jolly cooks shuttled amongthe theatre buffs ladled out bowls of soup and distributed bread     dig in lads the cooks shouted and turn over your currency whatsthe point of sitting  here who wants to slop up this swill
go home have agood drink a little bite thats the way     now you for instance  whatre  you  doing sitting  here old  mannikanor   ivanovich  was   directly   addressed  by   a  fat  cook  with   araspberrycoloured neck  as  he offered him a bowl in which  a lone cabbageleaf floated in some liquid     i dont have any i dont i dont nikanor  ivanovich cried out in aterrible voice you understand i dont     you  dont the  cook  bellowed in  a menacing  bass you dont heasked  in  a  tender womans  voice you  dont you  dont  he  murmuredsoothingly turning into the nurse praskovya fyodorovna     she was gently shaking nikanor ivanovich  by the shoulder  as he moanedin his sleep then the cooks melted  away and  the theatre with its curtainbroke up  through his  tears nikanor  ivanovich  made out his  room in thehospital and two  people in white coats  who were  by no means casual cooksgetting at people  with their advice but the doctor and that same praskovyafyodorovna
who was holding not a bowl but a little dish covered with gauzewith a syringe lying on it     what  is  all this nikanor  ivanovich said  bitterly  as  they weregiving  him the injection  i dont have  any and thats that let  pushkinturn over his currency for them i dont have any     no  you  dont  you  dont  the kindhearted praskovya  fyodorovnasoothed him and if you dont theres no more to be said     after  the injection nikanor  ivanovich  felt  better and  fell asleepwithout any dreams     but thanks to his cries alarm was communicated to room 120 where thepatient  woke up and began looking for his head and to room 118 where  theunknown master became restless and wrung  his hands  in  anguish looking atthe moon remembering the last bitter  autumn night  of his life a strip oflight under the basement door and uncurled hair     from room 118  the  alarm flew by way of  the balcony to  ivan and hewoke up and began to weep     but the doctor  quickly calmed all  these
anxious sorrowing heads andthey began to  fall asleep ivan  was  the last to become oblivious as dawnwas already breaking over the river after the medicine  which suffused hiswhole body calm  came like a wave and covered  him his  body grew lighterhis head basked in the warm wind  of  reverie he fell asleep and the  lastwaking thing he heard was the predawn  chirping of birds in the woods  butthey soon fell silent and he began dreaming that the sun was already  goingdown  over  bald mountain  and the mountain was cordoned  off  by a  doublecordon 

chapter 16 the execution       the sun was already going down over bald mountain and the mountain wascordoned off by a double cordon     the cavalry ala that  had cut across the  procurators path around nooncame  trotting  up to the hebron gate of the city its way had  already beenprepared   the  infantry   of  the  cappadocian  cohort   had   pushed  theconglomeration  of  people  mules  and camels to the  sides and  the  alatrotting  and  raising  white  columns  of dust  in  the  sky  came  to  anintersection where two roads met the  south  road leading to bethlehem andthe northwest  road to  jaffa the ala raced down the northwest road  thesame cappadocians were strung  out along the sides of the road and in  goodtime had driven to the sides of  it  all the caravans hastening to the feastin yershalaim  crowds  of  pilgrims stood behind the  cappadocians  havingabandoned their temporary striped  tents pitched right on the  grass goingon for  about  a halfmile the ala caught up with the second  cohort
of thelightning legion and having  covered another halfmile was  the  first  toreach the foot of  bald mountain here they dismounted the  commander brokethe ala up into  squads and  they cordoned off the  whole foot of the smallhill leaving open only the way up from the jaffa road     after some dme the  ala  was joined  at the hill by the second cohortwhich climbed one level higher and also encircled the hill in a wreath     finally the  century  under the  command  of mark ratslayer arrived itwent stretched  out in files along the sides of the road  and between thesefiles convoyed by the secret guard the three condemned men rode in a cartwhite boards hanging around  their necks with robber and rebel written  oneach of them in two languages  aramaic and greek     the  cart with  the condemned  men was  followed by  others laden  withfreshly hewn posts  with crosspieces ropes shovels buckets  and axes sixexecutioners  rode  in these carts they were  followed on  horseback by thecenturion
mark the chief  of the temple guard of yershalaim  and that samehooded man with whom  pilate  had had a momentary meeting in a darkened roomof the palace     a file of soldiers brought up the rear of the procession and behind itwalked about two thousand of the curious undaunted by the infernal heat andwishing to be  present at  the interesting spectacle the curious  from  thecity  were now  joined by  the  curious from among  the  pilgrims who  wereadmitted without  hindrance to the tail of  the procession under the shrillcries of the heralds who accompanied the column and cried aloud  what pilatehad cried out at around noon the procession drew itself up bald mountain     the  ala admitted everyone to the  second level but the second centurylet  only  those  connected with the  execution  go  further up  and  thenmanoeuvring quickly spread the crowd around the entire hill so that peoplefound  themselves between the  cordons  of infantry above and cavalry belownow they could watch the execution through
the sparse line of the infantry     and so more than three hours had gone  by since the procession climbedthe mountain and the sun was already going down over bald mountain but theheat was still unbearable  and  the soldiers in both cordons  suffered fromit grew  weary  with boredom and cursed the three robbers in their heartssincerely wishing them the speediest death     the little commander of the  ala  his  brow moist and the back of  hiswhite shirt  dark with sweat having  placed himself at the foot of the hillby the  open  passage went over to the leather  bucket of the  first  squadevery now and then  scooped handfuls of water from it drank and wetted histurban somewhat relieved by that he would step away and again begin pacingback and forth on the dusty road leading to  the top his long sword slappedagainst his laced leather boot the commander wished to give  his cavalrymenan example of endurance but pitying his soldiers he allowed them to sticktheir spears pyramidlike  in  the  ground
and throw their white cloaks overthem under these tents the syrians hid from the merciless sun the bucketswere quickly emptied and cavalrymen  from different squads took turns goingto  fetch water in the gully  below the hill  where  in the  thin  shade ofspindly  mulberries a  muddy  brook  was  living  out  its last  days in thedevilish  heat  there too  catching the  unsteady shade  stood the boredhorsehandlers holding the quieted horses     the weariness  of the soldiers and the abuse they  aimed at the robberswere understandable the procurators apprehensions concerning the disordersthat might occur at  the time of the execution in the city of yershalaim sohated by  him fortunately were not borne out and when the  fourth hour  ofthe  execution came there was contrary  to all expectations not  a singleperson left between the two files the infantry above and the cavalry belowthe sun had scorched the crowd and driven it back to yershalaim beyond  thefile of two roman centuries there were
only two dogs that belonged to no oneknew whom  and had for some reason ended up on the hill but the heat got tothem  too  and they lay down  with their  tongues hanging out panting andpaying no attention to  the greenbacked lizards the only beings not afraidof the  sun darting among the scorching stones and some sort of bigthornedplants that crept on the ground     no one  attempted to rescue  the condemned  men  either  in  yershalaimitself flooded with troops or here on the cordonedoff hill and the crowdwent back to  the city for  indeed there was absolutely nothing interestingin  this execution while there in the  city preparations were under way forthe great feast of passover which was to begin that evening     the  roman infantry  on  the  second level suffered still more than thecavalry the only thing the centurion ratslayer allowed his soldiers was  totake off their helmets  and cover their heads with white headbands dipped inwater  but he kept them standing and with their spears  in
their hands hehimself in  the  same kind of headband but dry not wet walked  about notfar  from the  group of executioners without even taking the silver plaqueswith lions muzzles off his shirt or removing his greaves sword and knifethe sun beat straight down on the centurion without doing  him any harm andthe  lions muzzles were impossible to look at   the eyes were  devoured bythe dazzling gleam of the silver which was as if boiling in the sun     ratslayers mutilated face expressed neither weariness nor displeasureand it seemed that the giant centurion  was capable of pacing like  that allday all night  and the  next day   in short for as  long as necessary ofpacing in the same way  holding his hands to the heavy belt with its bronzeplaques glancing in the same stern way  now  at the posts with the executedmen now at the file of  soldiers kicking  aside with the  toe of  a shaggyboot  in  the same  indifferent way  human  bones whitened by time  or smallflints that happened under his
feet     that  man in the hood  placed  himself  not  far from the  posts  on  athreelegged stool and sat there in complacent morionlessness though pokingthe sand with a twig from time to time out of boredom     what has  been said  about  there  not being a single person beyond thefile of legionaries  is  not quite true there was one person but he simplycould not be seen by everyone he had placed himself  not on the side wherethe way up  the  mountain was open and from  where it would  have been  mostconvenient to  watch the  execution but on  the north side where the slopewas  not gentle and accessible but uneven with gaps and clefts where in acrevice  clutching at  the heavencursed  waterless soil a sickly fig treewas trying to live     precisely under  it though it  gave no  shade this sole spectator whowas not a participant in the execution had established  himself and had saton a stone from  the very beginning that is for over three hours now yeshe had  chosen  not  the  best but 
the  worst  position  for  watching  theexecution  but still even from there the  posts could be  seen  and therecould also be seen  beyond the file of soldiers the two dazzling spots  onthe  centurions chest and that  was apparently quite enough for  a man whoobviously wished to remain little noticed and not be bothered by anyone     but  some four hours ago  at the start of  the execution this man hadbehaved quite differently  and might have been noticed very well which wasprobably why he had now changed his behaviour and secluded himself     it was  only when the procession came to the very top beyond the filethat  he had  first appeared and as  an obvious latecomer  at  that he wasbreathing hard and did not walk but ran up the hill pushing  his way andseeing  the file close together before  him as before everyone  else made anaive attempt pretending  he did not understand the angry shouts to  breakthrough the soldiers to the very place of execution where the condemned menwere already
being taken from the cart for that he received a heavy blow inthe  chest with  the  butt  end  of  a spear  and he  leaped back  from thesoldiers crying  out not in pain but  in despair at the legionary who  haddealt the  blow he cast a  dull  glance utterly indifferent  to everythinglike a man insensible to physical pain     coughing and breathless clutching  his chest he ran  around the hilltrying to find some  gap in the file on  the north side where he  could slipthrough  but it was  too  late the ring was closed  and the man his facedistorted with grief was forced to  renounce his attempts  to break throughto the carts from which the posts had already been unloaded these attemptswould  have led nowhere  except that  he would  have been seized and to bearrested on that day by no means entered his plans     and so he  went to the side towards  the crevice where it was quieterand nobody bothered him     now sitting on  the stone this  blackbearded man his eyes festeringfrom the sun
and lack of sleep was in anguish first he sighed opening histallith worn out in his wanderings gone from lightblue to dirty grey andbared his  chest which had been hurt by the spear and down which ran  dirtysweat  then in  unendurable pain he raised his eyes to the sky followingthe  three vultures that had long been  floating in  great  circles on highanticipating  an imminent feast then he peered with hopeless eyes into  theyellow earth and  saw on it  the halfdestroyed skull of a dog  and lizardsscurrying around it     the mans sufferings were so great that  at times  he began talking  tohimself     oh fool that i am   he muttered swaying on the stone in the painof his heart and clawing his swarthy  chest with his nails fool senselesswoman coward im not a man im carrion     he would  fall silent  hang his  head then  after drinking some warmwater from a wooden flask he would revive again and clutch now at the knifehidden on his chest under the tallith now at the  piece
of parchment  lyingbefore him on the stone next to a stylus and a pot of ink     on this parchment some notes had already been scribbled     the minutes run on and i matthew levi am here  on bald mountain andstill no death     further     the sun is sinking but no death     now matthew levi wrote hopelessly with the sharp stylus     god why are you angry with him send him death     having written this he sobbed  tearlessly and again wounded his  chestwith his nails     the reason  for levis  despair lay in the terrible misfortune that hadbefallen yeshua and him and besides that in the grave error that he leviin  his own opinion had committed  two  days earlier yeshua and  levi hadbeen in bethphage near yershalaim where they had visited a certain gardenerwho liked yeshuas preaching very much the two visitors had spent the wholemorning  working  in the garden helping  their  host and  planned to go toyershalaim towards evening when it cooled off but yeshua began to hurry forsome
reason said he had urgent business  in the city and left alone aroundnoontime  here lay  matthew levis  first error why why had he let him goalone     nor was matthew levi to go to yershalaim that evening he was struck bysome unexpected and terrible ailment he began to shake his whole  body wasfilled with fire his teeth chattered and he kept asking to  drink  all thetime     he  could  not go  anywhere  he collapsed on  a horse blanket  in  thegardeners shed and lay there till dawn on friday when the illness releasedlevi as unexpectedly as it had fallen upon him though he was still weak andhis  legs  trembled  he took  leave of his  host  and  oppressed  by  someforeboding of  disaster  went  to  yershalaim  there he learned  that  hisforeboding  had not deceived him   the disaster occurred  levi  was in thecrowd and heard the procurator announce the sentence     when the condemned men were led off  to the mountain  matthew levi ranalongside the file in the crowd of the curious trying
to let yeshua know insome  inconspicuous way that at least he levi was there with  him that hehad not abandoned him  on his  last  journey  and that  he was praying thatdeath would overtake yeshua as soon as possible but yeshua who was lookinginto the  distance towards  where he was being taken of course did  not seelevi     and then  when the  procession  had gone  about a halfmile  along theroad  a simple  and  ingenious  thought dawned  on matthew who  was  beingjostled by the crowd just next to the file and in his excitement he at onceshowered himself with curses for not having thought of it  earlier the fileof soldiers  was  not solid there were  spaces  between them  given  greatdexterity and a precise calculation one  could bend  down slip between twolegionaries make  it to  the cart and jump into  it  then yeshua would  besaved from suffering     one instant would be  enough to stab yeshua in the back  with  a knifecrying to him  yeshua  i  save  you  and go  with you  i  matthew
yourfaithful and only disciple     and if god granted  him  one more free instant he would also have timeto stab himself and avoid death on a post this last however was of littleinterest  to levi the former tax  collector he  was indifferent to  how hedied he wanted one thing that yeshua who had never in his  life done  theleast evil to anyone should escape torture     the plan was  a very good one but the fact of the matter was that levihad no knife with him nor did he have a single piece of money     furious with  himself  levi got  out of the crowd and ran back  to thecity  a single feverish  thought was leaping  in his burning  head how  toprocure a  knife there in  the city in any way possible and have  time  toovertake the procession     he ran up  to the  city gate manoeuvring amid the  throng  of caravansbeing  sucked  into the city and saw to his left the open door of  a littleshop where bread was  sold breathing  hard after running  down the scorchedroad levi got control  of
himself entered the shop very sedately  greetedthe woman behind the counter asked her to take the top loaf from the shelfwhich for some reason he liked better than the  others and  when she turnedaround silendy  and quickly  took  from the  counter that than  which therecould  be nothing better  a long  razorsharp bread  knife   and at  oncedashed out of the shop     a  few moments later he was again on the jaffa road but the processionwas no longer in sight he ran at  times  he had to drop down  right in thedust and lie motionless to recover his breath and so he would lie there tothe astonishment of people riding on mules or walking on foot to yershalaimhe would lie listening to his heart  pounding not only in  his chest but  inhis head  and ears  having recovered his breath a little he  would jump upand continue running but  ever  slower and slower when  he finally  caughtsight of the long procession raising dust in the distance it was already atthe foot of the hill     oh god    
levi  moaned  realizing that he was going  to be toolate and he was too late     when the fourth hour  of  the execution had  gone  by  levis tormentsreached their highest degree and  he  fell into a rage getting  up from thestone he flung to the ground the  stolen knife  stolen in  vain as he nowthought  crushed the flask with his foot depriving himself of water threwoff his kefia seized his thin hair and began cursing himself     he  cursed  himself calling  out meaningless words growled and  spatabused his father and mother for bringing a fool into the world     seeing  that  curses  and  abuse  had  no  effect  and  nothing in  thesunscorched place  was changed by  them  he clenched his dry fists raisedthem squinting  to  the  sky  to  the  sun that was  sliding ever  lowerlengthening the  shadows and  going  to  fall into  the  mediterranean  anddemanded an immediate miracle from  god he demanded that  god  at once sendyeshua death     opening his  eyes he became convinced that
everything on the  hill wasunchanged except that  the  blazing spots on the centurions chest had goneout  the sun was sending its  rays into the backs of the  executed men whowere facing yershalaim then levi shouted     i curse you god     in  a rasping voice he shouted that he was convinced of gods injusticeand did not intend to believe in him any longer     tou  are deaf growled levi if  you  were  not deaf  you would haveheard me and killed him straight away     shutting his eyes levi waited  for the fire that would  fall from  thesky and strike him instead this did  not happen and  levi without openinghis  eyes  went on  shouting offensive and sarcastic things at the  sky heshouted about his  total disappointment about the existence of  other  godsand  religions yes another god  would not have  allowed it he would neverhave allowed a man like yeshua to be burnt by the sun on a post     i was mistaken  levi cried in a completely hoarse voice you are  agod of evil or are your
eyes completely  clouded by  smoke from  the templecensers  and have your  ears ceased  to hear  anything but  the  trumpetingnoises of the  priests you  are not an almighty god you are a black god icurse you god of robbers their soul and their protector     here something  blew into the face  of  the former  tax  collector andsomething rustled under his feet  it blew once more and  then opening hiseyes  levi saw that either  under the influence of his curses or owing toother reasons everything in  the world was changed the sun had disappearedbefore reaching the sea where it sank every evening having swallowed it astorm cloud  was rising  menacingly and inexorably  against the  sky  in thewest its edges were already seething with white foam its black smoky bellywas tinged with  yellow the storm  cloud was growling threads of fire fellfrom it now and again down the  jaffa road down the meagre  hinnom valleyover the tents  of the pilgrims driven by the  suddenly risen wind pillarsof dust
went flying     levi fell silent  trying to grasp  whether the storm that was about tocover  yershalaim would  bring any  change  in the  fate of the  unfortunateyeshua and straight away  looking  at the threads  of  fire cutting up thecloud he  began to  ask that  lightning  strike yeshuas  post repentantlylooking into the clear sky that had  not yet been devoured by the cloud andwhere  the  vultures  were veering on  one wing to escape  the  storm  levithought he had been insanely hasty with his curses now god was not going tolisten to him     turning his gaze to the foot of the hill levi fixed on the place wherethe strungout cavalry regiment stood and saw that considerable changes hadtaken place there from above levi  was able to distinguish  very well  thesoldiers bustling about pulling  spears out  of the ground throwing cloakson  the horsehandlers  trotting towards the road  leading black  horses bytheir bridles  the regiment  was moving off  that was clear  spitting andshielding himself
with  his  hand from the dust blowing  in  his  face levitried to grasp  what it might  mean  if the cavalry  was about  to leave heshifted  his gaze  further up  and made  out  a little figure  in  a crimsonmilitary chlamys climbing  towards the place of execution and here  a chillcame over  the  heart  of the  former  tax collector in  anticipation of thejoyful end     the  man  climbing the  mountain  in the  fifth  hour  of the  robberssufferings  was the commander  of the cohort who  had  come  galloping fromyershalaim accompanied by an aide at a gesture  from ratslayer the file ofsoldiers parted and  the centurion saluted the tribune  the latter takingratslayer aside  whispered something  to  him the centurion  saluted him asecond time and moved towards the group of executioners who were sitting onstones  at the  foot of the posts the tribune meanwhile  directed his stepstowards  the  one  sitting  on  the threelegged  stool and the  seated manpolitely rose to meet the tribune and the tribune 
said something to him ina low voice and the two  went  over  to the posts they were joined  by thehead of the temple guard     ratslayer casting  a squeamish sidelong glance at the dirty rags lyingon the ground  near the  posts rags that  had  recently been the criminalsclothing  and which  the executioners had rejected called two of them  andordered     follow me     from the nearest post came a hoarse senseless song gestas hanging onit had lost his mind from the flies and sun  towards the end  of  the thirdhour and was  now quiedy  singing something  about  grapes  but his  headcovered with a turban occasionally swayed all the same  and then the fliesrose sluggishly from his face and setded on it again     dysmas on the second post suffered more than die other two because hedid  not   lose   consciousness  and  he  swung  his  head  constantly  andrhythmically right and left so diat his ears struck his shoulders     yeshua  was more fortunate than the other two in  die very first

hebegged the executioner hoarsely     give him a drink     it  was growing ever darker the  storm cloud had already poured acrosshalf the sky aiming towards yershalaim boiling white clouds raced ahead ofthe storm cloud suffused with black moisture and fire there was a flash anda thunderclap right over the hill the  executioner removed  the sponge fromthe spear     praise the  magnanimous  hegemon he  whispered solemnly  and  gendypricked yeshua in the heart he twitched and whispered     hegemon        blood ran down his  belly his lower  jaw twitched convulsively and hishead dropped     at the second thunderclap the executioner was already giving  dysmas adrink and with the same words     praise the hegemon  killed him as well     gestas  deprived  of  reason  cried out  fearfully  as  soon  as  theexecutioner  came  near him  but when  the sponge  touched his  lips he  growled something  and seized  it  widi his teeth  a few seconds later  hisbody too slumped as much as
the ropes would allow     the  man in the hood followed the  executioner  and the centurion  andafter him came the head of the temple guard stopping at die first post theman  in die hood  examined the bloodcovered yeshua attentively touched hisfoot with his white hand and said to his companions     dead     the same was repeated at die odier two posts     after that the  tribune motioned to the centurion and turning startedoff die hilltop together with die head of the temple guard and the man in mehood  semidarkness  set  in and lightning farrowed  the black  sky  firesuddenly sprayed out of it and die centurions shout  raise the cordonwas drowned  in  rumbling the happy soldiers rushed headlong down the hillputting on their helmets     darkness covered yershalaim     torrents of  rain poured down suddenly and caught the centuries halfwaydown the hill the deluge fell so  terribly  that the soldiers  were alreadypursued by raging streams as they ran downhill soldiers slipped and fell
inthe sodden clay hurrying to get to the level road along which  now barelyvisible through the sheet  of water   the  thoroughly  drenched cavalry washeading  for yershalaim  a few  minutes later only one man remained in  thesmoky brew of storm water and fire on the hill     shaking the not uselessly stolen knife falling  from  slippery ledgesclutching  at whatever  was  there  sometimes  crawling  on  his  knees hestrained  towards the  posts he  now vanished  in total  darkness  now wassuddenly illumined by a tremulous light     having made his way to the posts already up to his ankles in water hetore  off his heavy watersoaked  tauith  remaining just in his  shirt andclung to yeshuas feet he  cut the  ropes on his shins stepped  up  on thelower crossbar embraced yeshua and freed his arms from the upper bonds thenaked  wet body  of yeshua collapsed on levi and brought him to the groundlevi wanted to heave  it on to his shoulders straight away but some thoughtstopped him  he left  the
body with its thrownback head and outspread armson the ground in the water and ran his feet slithering apart in the clayeymire to  the other posts he  cut  the ropes on them  as well and the  twobodies collapsed on the ground     several minutes  passed  and all that remained on the  top of the hillwas these two bodies and the three empty posts water beat on the bodies androlled them over     by  that time both levi  and the  body of  yeshua  were  gone  from thehilltop

chapter 17 an unquiet day       on friday morning that is the day after the  accursed seance all theavailable  staff  of  the  variety   the  bookkeeper  vassily  stepanovichlastochkin  two accountants  three  typists  both boxoffice  girls  themessengers  ushers cleaning women   in short all those available  werenot  at  their  places  doing  their  jobs  but  were  all sitting  on  thewindowsills  looking out on sadovaya and watching what  was going on by thewall of the variety by  this  wall a queue  of many thousands clung in  tworows its tail reaching to kudrinskaya square at the head of the line stoodsome two dozen scalpers well known to theatrical moscow     the  line behaved with much  agitation  attracting  the notice  of thecitizens  streaming  past   and   was  occupied  with  the   discussion  ofinflammatory  tales about  yesterdays unprecedented seance of  black magicthese same tales caused the greatest consternation in the bookkeeper vassilvstepanovich who had not been present at the previous
evenings performancethe  ushers  told  of god  knows  what  among other things that  after  theconclusion of the famous seance some female citizens went running around inthe street  looking quite indecent and so on in  the same vein  the modestand quiet vassily stepanovich merely blinked his eyes listening to the talltales of these wonders and  decidedly did not  know what to undertake  andyet  something had to be  undertaken  and precisely by  him because he nowturned out to be the senior member of the whole variety team     by ten oclock the line of  people desiring tickets had swelled so muchthat  rumour  of  it  reached  the  police  and  with astonishing swiftnessdetachments  were sent both on foot  and mounted to bring  this line  intosome sort of order however in itself  even  an orderly snake  a  halfmilelong  presented  a  great temptation and  caused  utter  amazement  in thecitizens on sadovaya     that  was  outside but  inside the  variety things were  also none toogreat early
in the morning the telephones began to ring and went on ringingwithout  interruption in  likhodeevs  office  in  rimskys office at  thebookkeepers in the box office and in varenukhas office     vassily stepanovich at first made some answer the boxoffice girl alsoanswered the ushers  mumbled something  into  the telephones but then theystopped altogether because to  questions of where  likhodeev varenukha andrimsky were there was decidedly no answer at first they  tried  to get offby saying  likhodeevs at home  but the reply to  this  was that they hadcalled him at home and at home they said likhodeev was at the variety     an agitated lady called started asking for rimsky was advised to callhis wife to which the receiver sobbing answered that she was his wife andthat  rimskv was  nowhere to be found some sort of nonsense was  beginningthe cleaning  woman  had already told  everybody that  when she  came to thefindirectors office to  clean she saw  the door wide open  the lights
onthe window to the garden broken the armchair lying on the floor and no onein the office     shortly  after ten oclock  madame rimsky burst  into the variety shewas  sobbing and wringing her  hands vassily stepanovich was  utterly at  aloss  and  did not know how to counsel  her  then at half past ten came thepolice their first and perfecdy reasonable question was     whats going on here dozens whats this all about     the team stepped  back bringing forward the pale  and agitated vassilystepanovich he  had  to  call things by  their  names  and confess that theadministration  of   the  variety  in  the  persons  of  the  director  thefindirector and  the administrator had  vanished and no one knew where thatthe master of  ceremonies had been taken  to  a  psychiatric  hospital afteryesterdays seance  and that to put it briefly this  seance yesterday hadfrankly been a scandalous seance     the sobbing madame rimsky having been calmed down as much as possiblewas sent  home and
the greatest interest was shown in  the cleaning womansstory about  the shape in which the findirectors office had been found thestaff  were asked to go to their places and get  busy and in  a short whilethe  investigation  appeared  in  the  variety  building  accompanied  by asharpeared muscular ashcoloured dog with extremely intelligent eyes thewhisper spread at once among the variety staff that the  dog was  none otherthan the famous ace of  diamonds  and so it  was his behaviour amazed themall  the  moment  ace  of diamonds ran into  the findirectors  office  hegrowled baring his monstrous  yellow fangs then crouched on his belly andwith some sort of look of anguish and at the same  dme of rage in his  eyescrawled  towards the broken window overcoming his fear he suddenly  jumpedup on the windowsill and throwing back his  sharp muzzle  howled savagelyand angrily he refused  to leave the window growled and twitched and kepttrying to jump out     the dog was taken from the office
and turned loose in the lobby whencehe walked  out  through  the  main  entrance  to the  street  and led  thosefollowing  him  to the  cab  stand  there  he lost  the  trail he  had beenpursuing after that ace of diamonds was taken away     the  investigation settled  in  varenukhas  office  where they  begansummoning  in  turn  all   the  variety  staff  members  who  had  witnessedyesterdays events during the seance it must be said that the investigationhad  at every step to  overcome  unforeseen difficulties  the  thread  keptsnapping off in their hands     there had been  posters right right but  during  the night they  hadbeen  pasted over  with new  ones and now strike me  dead  there wasnt asingle  one  to be found and the magician himself where had he come  fromah who knows but there was a contract drawn up with him     t suppose so the agitated vassily stepanovich replied     and if one was drawn up it had to go through bookkeeping     most assuredly responded the agitated
vassily stepanovich     then where is it     not  here  the  bookkeeper  replied  turning  ever  more  pale  andspreading his arms     and indeed  no trace  of the contract  was found in  the files  of  thebookkeeping  office  nor  at  the  findirectors  nor  at  likhodeevs  orvarenukhas     and what was this magicians name vassily stepanovich did not know hehad  not  been  at  the  seance  yesterday the ushers  did  not  know  theboxoffice girl wrinkled her  brow wrinkled  it thought  and thought  andfinally said     wo    woland seems like      or maybe not woland maybe not woland maybe faland     it turned  out that in the foreigners  bureau they had heard preciselynothing  either  about  any woland  or for  that  matter  any  faland  themagician     the  messenger  karpov said  that  this  same  magician was  supposedlystaying  in ukhodeevs apartment the  apartment was of  course visited atonce  no magician was found there likhodeev himself was not there eitherthe

chimney and throughthis  soughing  he  heard  scraps  of the  stories  the  ushers  told  aboutyesterdays cat who had taken part in the seance ohhoho might that notbe our same little puss     having  got nowhere  with  the  commission  the  conscientious vassilystepanovich decided to visit its affiliate located in vagankovsky lane andto calm himself a little he walked the distance to die affiliate on foot     the affiliate for city spectacles  was housed in a peeling old  mansionset back from the street and was  famous  for  the porphyry  columns in itsvestibule but it was not the  columns that struck visitors to the affiliatethat day but what was going on at the foot of them     several visitors  stood in stupefaction  and stared  at a  weeping girlsitting behind a small table on  which lay special literature  about variousspectacles which the  girl sold at that moment the girl was not  offeringany of this  literature  to anyone and only  waved  her hand at sympatheticinquiries while at
the  same time from above from below  from the sidesand from all sections of the affiliate poured the ringing of at least twentyoverwrought telephones     after weeping for a while the girl suddenly gave a start and cried outhysterically     here it  comes again and unexpectedly began singing in  a  tremuloussoprano     glorious sea sacred baikal       a  messenger appeared  on  the  stairs shook his fist at someone  andbegan singing along with the girl in a dull weakvoiced baritone     glorious boat a barrel of cisco       the messengers voice was joined by  distant voices the choir began toswell and  finally the song resounded in  all corners of the affiliate  inthe neighbouring room no 6 which housed the account comptrollers sectionone powerful slightly husky octave stood out particularly     hey barguzin   make the  waves  rise  and  fallbawled the messenger on the stairs     tears flowed down the girls face  she tried to clench her  teeth buther
mouth opened of itself as she sang an octave higher than the messenger     this young lads ready to frisko     what  struck  the  silent  visitors  to  the  affiliate  was  that  thechoristers scattered in various places sang quite harmoniously as  if thewhole choir stood there with its eyes fixed on some invisible director     passersby  in  vagankovsky  lane  stopped  by  the  fence of the yardwondering at the gaiety that reigned in the affiliate     as soon as the first verse came to an end the singing suddenly ceasedagain  as  if  to  a  directors  baton  the  messenger  quiedy  swore  anddisappeared     here the front door  opened and in it  appeared a citizen in  a summerjacket from under which  protruded the skirts of a white coat and with hima policeman     take measures doctor i implore you the girl cried hysterically     the secretary of  the  affiliate ran out to the  stairs and  obviouslyburning with shame and embarrassment began falteringly     you see doctor we 
have a case of some sort of mass hypnosis and soits  necessary that   he did not finish the sentence began to choke onhis words and suddenly sang out in a tenor     shilka and nerchinsk        fool the girl had time to shout but without explaining who she wasabusing  produced instead a forced roulade and herself  began singing aboutshilka and nerchinsk     get  hold  of  yourself  stop  singing  the  doctor  addressed  diesecretary     there was every indication  that the secretary would himself have givenanything  to stop singing but stop singing he  could not and together withthe choir he brought to the hearing of passersby in  the lane the news thatin the wilderness he was not touched  by voracious  beast nor brought downby bullet of shooters     the moment the verse ended the girl was the first to receive a dose ofvalerian  from  the doctor  who  then  ran after the  secretary to give theothers theirs     excuse me  dear citizeness vassily stepanovich  addressed the
girldid a black cat pay you a visit     what  cat  the girl cried in anger an ass its an ass  weve  gotsitting in  the affiliate  and  adding  to that let  him hear ill telleverything  she indeed told what had happened     it turned out that the manager of  the  city affiliate who has made aperfect mess of lightened entertainment the girls words suffered from amania for organizing all sorts of little clubs     blew smoke in the authorities eyes screamed the girl     in the course of a year this manager had  succeeded in organizing a dubof lermontov studies of chess and checkers of pingpong and of horsebackriding for the summer he was threatening  to organize clubs of freshwatercanoeing and alpinism and  so today during lunchbreak this manager comesin        with some son of a bitch on  his arm the girl went on hailingfrom  nobody  knows  where   in  wretched  checkered  trousers  a  crackedpincenez and    with a completely impossible mug       
and  straight away  the  girl  said  he recommended him to  all thoseeating  in  the  affiliates  dining  room  as  a  prominent  specialist  inorganizing choralsinging clubs     the faces of the future alpinists darkened but the manager immediatelycalled on everyone to cheer up while the specialist joked a little laugheda little and  swore an oath  that singing  takes  no time at all but thatincidentally there was a whole load of benefits to be derived from it     well  of course as the girl said the first to pop up were fanov  andkosarchuk wellknown affiliate toadies who announced that they would  signup here  the rest of the  staff  realized that there was no  way around thesinging and they too  had to  sign up for the club  they decided to singduring the lunch break since the rest of the time was taken up by lermontovand checkers the manager to set an example declared that he  was a tenorand   everything  after   that  went  as  in  a  bad  dream  the  checkeredspecialistchoirmaster
bawled out     do  mi  sol  do    dragged the  most  bashful  from  behind  thebookcases  where  they  had tried  to  save themselves from  singing  toldkosarchuk he had perfect pitch began whining squealing begging them to bekind  to an  old  singingmaster tapped  the  tuning fork  on  his knucklebeseeched them to strike up glorious sea     strike  up they did and  gloriously the checkered one really knew hisbusiness they finished the first  verse here the director excused himselfsaid  back  in  a  minute    and disappeared they  thought he  wouldactually come back  in  a minute but  ten  minutes  went by and  he was notthere the staff was overjoyed  he had run away     then suddenly somehow of themselves they began the second verse theywere  all led by kosarchuk who may not have had perfect pitch but did havea rather pleasant high tenor they sang  it through no director they movedto  their places but  had not managed to sit down when against their willthey began
to sing  to stop was impossible after three minutes of silencethey would  strike up  again silence  strike  up then they realized thatthey were in trouble the manager locked himself in his office from shame     here the girls story was interrupted  the valerian had not done muchgood     a quarter  of an hour  later  three trucks  drove up to the  fence  invagankovsky and the entire staff of the affiliate the manager at its headwas loaded on to them     as  soon as the first truck after lurching  in  the gateway drove outinto the lane the staff members who were standing on  the platform holdingeach others  shoulders opened their  mouths and the whole lane  resoundedwith the popular song the second truck picked it up then the third and sothey drove  on passersby hurrying about their own business would cast onlya fleeting glance at the trucks not surprised in the least thinking it wasa group excursion to the country and they were indeed going to the countrythough not on an excursion
but to professor stravinskys clinic     half an hour later the  bookkeeper who had lost his head  completelyreached  the  financial sector hoping finally to get rid of the  boxofficemoney having  learned from experience by  now  he first peeked  cautiouslyinto  the  oblong  hall  where   behind  frostedglass  windows  with  goldlettering the staff was sitting here the bookkeeper discovered no signs ofalarm or scandal it was quiet as it ought to be in a decent institution     vassily stepanovich  stuck his  head  through  the  window  with  cashdeposits written over it greeted some unfamiliar clerk and politely askedfor a deposit slip     what do you need it for the clerk in the window asked     the bookkeeper was amazed     i want to turn over some cash im from the variety     one moment the clerk replied and instantly closed the opening in thewindow with a grille     strange  thought  the  bookkeeper  his  amazement  was perfectlynatural it was the  first rime in his 
life that  he had  met with  such  acircumstance everybody knows  how hard it is to get  money obstacles to itcan always be found but there had been  no case in the bookkeepers  thirtyyears of experience when anyone either an official or a private person hadhad a hard rime accepting money     but at last  the  little grille  moved  aside and the bookkeeper againleaned to the window     do you have a lot the clerk asked     twentyone thousand seven hundred and eleven roubles     oho the  clerk answered ironically for  some  reason  and handed thebookkeeper a green slip     knowing the form well the bookkeeper instantly filled it out and beganto untie the string  on the  bundle when he unpacked  his  load everythingswam before his eyes he murmured something painfully     foreign money flitted before  his eyes there were  stacks of  canadiandollars british pounds dutch guldens latvian lats estonian kroons        there he is  one of  those tricksters from the  variety a  menacingvoice
resounded over the dumbstruck  bookkeeper and  straight away  vassilystepanovich was arrested

but then what  wasthis about  a funeral or was he in a bad way and foreseeing death that waspossible but such precision was in the highest degree strange how could heknow he would be buried on friday at three pm an astonishing telegram     however intelligence is granted to intelligent  people so as  to  sortout entangled affairs very simple a mistake had been made and the messagehad  been  distorted the word have had  undoubtedly come there from  someomer telegram  in place of the word berlioz which got moved and  wound upat the end  of  the telegram with  such an emendation the meaning  of  thetelegram became clear though of course tragic     when the  outburst of grief  that struck maximilian  andreevichs  wifesubsided he at once started preparing to go to moscow     one secret  about maximilian andreevich ought  to be revealed there isno arguing that  he felt  sorry for his wifes nephew  who  had died in thebloom of life but of course being a practical man he realized that therewas
